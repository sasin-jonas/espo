   "annotation": "The brain and nervous system are an important and complex part of the medical sciences. By creating artificial electronic connections to nervous tissue, neural activity can be sensed and also externally modified by electrical stimulation. Smart biomedical devices, built on the interconnection of electronics with living systems, represent one of the fastest growing and promising new directions in medicine today. Such devices can be used to diagnose and treat neurological diseases and injuries. This dynamic field is known as bioelectronic medicine. In parallel, the last decades have been characterized by major advances in nano- and micro-technologies for electronics and optoelectronics. Unfortunately, it is currently difficult to translate state-of-the-art electronic solutions into practice, especially in the European medical community. This gap is largely the result of limited communication and collaboration between electronic technology experts, biomedical engineers and physicians. NeuroBMI's goal is to bridge this gap and create a solid base for manufacturing and testing bioelectronic devices in the Czech Republic. Much of the necessary infrastructure and expertise is already in place, but interdisciplinary links need to be established and deepened with clear intentions. FP1 is dedicated to the development of new neural interface devices for the consortium as a whole and for the wider neuroscience community. FP1 contains four research objectives, A-D: A: Implantable brain probes to advance neuroscience research in animals; B: Implantable neural interfaces for peripheral nerves in animal models; C: New integrated magnetoelectronic devices for wireless power transfer; D: Accelerated component lifetime testing and systematic investigation of functional failures.",

   "annotation": "Intracerebral EEG (iEEG) is an investigation performed in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy prior to surgical treatment. It aims at identifying the origin of epileptic seizures within the brain to target surgery and cure the epilepsy. Due to its unmatched temporal resolution (in the order of the millisecond) and spatial precision (millimetric), iEEG offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms leading to the emergence of seizure, develop novel biomarkers to improve the outcome of epilepsy surgery (e.g. high-frequency oscillations (HFOs)) but also investigate brain physiology. Indeed, many of the 150 to 250 recording leads available in each investigated patients are located in normal brain tissue, and thus enable to study normal brain function, including cognition. The main limitation of this research field is the limited number of patients undergoing such investigation, about 500 per year in Europe. This makes iEEG data particularly well suited to data sharing, data re-use and data FAIRification. With this view in mind, the European Flagship Human Brain Project has developed a platform dedicated to this objective, the Human Intracerebral EEG platform (HIP). This cloud-based, GDPR-compliant open-source platform precisely aims at sharing and re-using iEEG data, software and research projects at an international scale. Two of the partners (CHUV and HCL) were involved in this development, with CHUV being its product owner. The first beta release of the HIP was performed last September, and the platform will be available to develop use-cases from February 2023.",

Typically, these two aspects are currently studied separately. This project will improve sharing of personnel, research infrastructures and capacities in these two areas and will thereby bring major added value for chemical biology science and fulfil the planned objectives. \nThe main strategic goal of this project is to build a top-quality research hub in the field of chemical biology that will generate globally competitive know-how with attractive commercial potential and significant societal impact. The project will exploit the long-term investment of MUNI into this research area – specifically building of University Campus Bohunice (UKB), followed by setting up the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and European Centre of excellence in Environmental Health sciences (RECETOX), implementation of numerous large research infrastructures into UKB environment, and more recently by the planned launch of the BioPharmaHub and integration of the Faculty of Pharmacy to MUNI.\nThis goal will be achieved by intensifying of multidisciplinary interaction among the relevant workplaces (mostly located within one campus), using the potential of the most competitive research teams at MUNI. In addition, we plan to attract top-class junior researchers working in the field of chemical biology and to intensify the contacts with the best research institutions abroad.

   "annotation": "Every day, people all over the world seek out doctors with a range of subjective complaints or with already developed objective signs of particular diseases. The task of physicians is to recognise the typical patterns of diagnoses in this jumble of information (\"pattern recognition/inductive reasoning\") or, if no pattern is recognised, to deduce other possible diagnoses from them (\"deductive reasoning\"). The establishment of a correct diagnosis is an essential step in the initiation of correct and effective treatment, and therefore the process of differential diagnosis and its perfect mastery is a fundamental skill for every physician. In case of uncertainty, or in the presence of general symptoms occurring in several different diseases, various (bio)markers can help in the differential diagnostic analysis, which should reduce the risk of a possible diagnostic error. Similarly, answering the frequent question of our patients \"What's next for me?\", i.e. to provide the patient with information about the future course of his/her disease, is often difficult, and it is the identification of new (bio)markers that may enable this prognostic stratification.\n The aim of the project is to find new potential (bio)markers that would be helpful in the course of differential diagnosis and prognostic stratification of internal diseases. The first specific aim of the project is to identify biomarkers that will facilitate the differential diagnosis of proteinuria, limb edema and also the estimation of early recurrence of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation. The second specific aim of the project is to identify markers that allow risk stratification of women with gestational diabetes mellitus.\n The project builds on previous DIDIPRON 1-5 projects that ran from 2017-2022. During that period, they supported 3 successful dissertation defenses and 2 successful P-POOL student defenses and have supported the development of science at the Second Internal Medicine Clinic over the long term. Two undergraduate students, two postgraduate students and their supervisors will participate in the project. \n In 2023, project outputs will include presentation of original results at conferences in the country or abroad and preparation/publication of manuscripts for impact factor journals. Students will also collect data for their thesis and dissertation.",

It is, thus, crucial to discover the pathological pathway cascades or causality involved in the development and progression of the disease. For this purpose, we aim to uncover the role of the choroid plexus, one of the most understudied and yet, essential structures of the brain in physiologically normal and disease settings. To investigate the molecular events alterations in the choroid plexus during Alzheimer’s disease development, we plan to implement interdisciplinary and integrative approaches, including transcriptome profiling and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We will sequence and quantify the transcriptional and translational output of the genetically and pharmaceutically manipulated cells, utilising Next Generation Sequencing. Then, we will employ AI on the extensive generated data sets to determine the best set of molecules that are highly differentially expressed in Alzheimer’s disease. We will gather time-tagged experimental data in three runs. For each run, we will measure 100+ molecular alterations in at least 10 different experimental conditions at 10 different time-point intervals (H1-H48), making a sample size of 100 per each round of the experiment. Experimental data will be analysed using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs), and an AI-based meta-classifier will be designed to create a meta-model at the end of each run. For the last run, as we will have a sufficient sample size, we will apply the Deep Reinforcement Learning technique to create and validate the final meta-model. Utterly, we will design, implement, and validate an intelligent recommender system to facilitate the identification of new pathways involved in the initiation and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. This study will also provide insights into therapeutic approaches and the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease.",

Early detection of abnormalities in cerebral cortex morphology are a promising approach leading to better diagnostics and treatment. \nWe propose an interdisciplinary cooperation between researchers in MR imaging, signal processing and analysis, data science and modelling, machine learning, and neurobiology of mental disorders to deliver a method for imaging and measuring of brain cortical subcomponents. This novel neuroimaging method will be based on tailored T1 relaxometry, component modelling, classification with machine learning algorithms, and signal transformations. The ability of the proposed method to capture the targeted fine gray matter structures will be evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art results as well.  \nUsing this multidisciplinary approach, we aim at increasing the spatial resolution of brain structural magnetic resonance imaging which at its current state does not enable to directly detect and evaluate relevant neuropathological features. Our proposed neuroimaging method will enable visualization and measurement of the cortical subcomponents that correspond to individual cortical layers. \nThe enhancement in the resolution will enable interpretation of the disease processes, treatment effects and their mutual interactions in vivo, and deliver missing information for better diagnostics and treatment regimens in psychiatry. \nFeasibility of our aims is supported by preliminary results, and we aim at extending already existing international collaborations.",

Migrastatic strategies represent a unique therapeutic approach preventing the development of systemic malignant disease and limiting cancer-related death. As the migration machinery has been shown to promote metastatic dissemination, a successful migrastatic therapy may reduce the need for high-dose cytotoxic therapies currently used to prevent the risk of metastatic dissemination, which can be beneficial to a patient's well-being. The best targets for migrastatic therapy would be those that are required by all forms of motility, such as ATP availability, mitochondrial metabolism, and cytoskeleton rearrangement.Pentamethinium salts (PMS) are a group of compounds characterized by fluorescence and variable cytotoxicity depending on the structure of the molecule and can play an important role in influencing the migration potential of tumor cells. PMS exhibit exceptional affinity and selectivity for cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane and have excellent photostability, fluorescence properties and low phototoxicity.

   "annotation": "Stress, anxiety, and depression are highly prevalent during pregnancy, reaching more than 33, 15 and 12%, respectively. These prenatal exposures have long-lasting consequences for the child, manifesting as emotional and behavioral problems. Still, the mechanisms of this intergenerational transmission are not well understood. The ambition of MaHeChiDe is to identify the mechanisms underlying the relationships between maternal health during pregnancy and brain and behavior in the child. We aim to test the mediatory role of inflammation and accelerated aging in these relationships and demonstrate what environmental factors might magnify or protect against the negative impact of maternal illness during pregnancy. Preliminary work from my group demonstrated long-lasting impact of maternal depression during pregnancy on aging of the brain in young adulthood but the knowledge of the mechanisms has been limited by the lack of human longitudinal data with rich biosamples, neuroimaging, and decent sample size. Moreover, detailed assessments in early life, when the processes emerge, might be critical. We hypothesize that maternal mental health problems will be associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers and higher epigenetic age in the pregnant mother. We also hypothesize that higher levels of these markers will be in turn associated with lower epigenetic gestational age in the newborn and altered biological aging, neurodevelopment, and cognitive skills in childhood. If succeeded, this high risk – high gain project would provide ground-breaking new insights into the mechanisms of developmental programming and allow development of targeted interventions that would reduce the odds of mental illness in the new generations.",

   "annotation": "In episodic healthcare, an ‘episode’ of care is provided to the patients for some urgent or emergency condition that is short term.  Episodic healthcare practices are ‘hospital-centric’ and are a norm since decades. Even though such system works successfully for routine ailments such as common cold, sore throat, and flu, but it is not suitable for chronic diseases and/or behavioral issues such as diabetes, depression, substance abuse, and cancer. Such conditions need multiple visits to doctors, constant treatments, and screening from time to time. All of this leads to a burden not only on patients and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system as a whole. All this points towards the need of continuous healthcare monitoring to either predict healthcare issues or diagnose them at very early stage, before they turn into chronic issues. Consequently, the world is moving towards ‘patient-centric’ continuum healthcare system focused on routine physical check-ups. Unfortunately, despite an alarming rise in the cases of mental issues, such systems are not yet well established for routine mental health check-ups. This project proposes to develop routine mental health check-ups based on both subjective as well as objective testing that can be used in conjunction with routine physical health check-ups.",

One reason could be the lack of a sensitive high-throughput screening (HTS) system for large chemical libraries. Notably, the state-of-the-art eIF4F inhibitor screening approach uses proximity ligation, a slow, costly, low-sensitivity technique with high background. We took advantage of our recent unpublished findings in melanoma biology to develop a very robust luciferase-based HTS system that will help us to rapidly screen large libraries to identify and characterize compounds targeting eIF4F. New eIF4F inhibitors suitable for clinical use could transform the therapy outcomes for melanoma patients bearing tumors that developed resistance to clinical BRAF/MEK inhibitors.",

Subpleural nodules in the lung parenchyma are usually not visible intraoperatively and their detection is possible only with the help of gentle palpation by the surgeon. However, this is often associated with the need to perform an open thoracotomy. Moreover, some small nodules, especially non-solid and sub-solid nodules, have similar rigidity to normal parenchyma and therefore are not palpable. Several techniques were developed, including patent blue V dye application under CT control. Patent blue V can rapidly diffuse into the marked tissues, which are then visually identified by the surgeon. Several studies using patent blue V to localize and facilitate nodule resection were performed. However, all were retrospective and to our best knowledge, no prospective study was done so far. We hypothesize that using patent blue V to guide lung node resection before VATS wedge resection is a safe technique to lower the rate of conversions to thoracotomy, postoperative complications, and mortality. Accordingly, this study will aim to compare intra and postoperative complications, hospital and ICU LOS, quality of life, and 30 days mortality in patients undergoing lung node resection using patent blue V and without.",

This indicates that, contrary to the common view, meiotic DSBs are divided into specific populations that may be targeted differently to DSBR vs. SDSA. Moreover, we show that shifts in the mode of resection are correlated with the transition between these pathways.

Our working hypothesis is that early (class 1) and late (class 2) DSBs processing is linked to DSBR/SDSA pathway choice. Our approach will be to determine how DSBs are resected in the germline and the time constraints of this process and will show that class 1 and class 2 DSBs employ different resection modes. We expect to identify two pathways; one involved in promoting and one in inhibiting the transition from class 1 to class 2 DSB processing modes.",

We will analyze the differences in melatonin synthesis by DMD hPSCs and their impact on NOS-initiated-ROS-mediated deregulation of key signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT) and the effect on stem cell fate alteration. We will analyze dysregulated circadian clock, clock genes and CCGs including NOS and their impact on hPSC self-renewal, differentiation into cardiomyocytes (CM) and their ability to induce CM death.

However, by using standard in vitro techniques of cell aggregation, discontinuous media exchange and slow diffusion of nutrients, the population of organoids is highly heterogeneous and their size is limited to small structures. Moreover, in the case of lung organoids, it is difficult to reproduce the cell spectrum and branching complexity of lung tissue without the presence of mesenchyme and capillaries. Thus, it is clear that morphogenesis of larger segments must be supported by the creation of an appropriate microenvironment, including flow, concentration gradient of signaling molecules, and the presence of endothelial and stromal cells. This project focuses on the implementation of microfluidic systems to generate lung organoids in combination with a network of capillaries to reveal the conditions and factors that drive lung morphogenesis and reproduce the cellular interactions that occur in vivo.",

However, the function of most of these cryptic splice sites, or even entire hidden exons, has not yet been revealed. Thus, these sites (exons) are probably not efficiently used for splicing but may still be recognized and/or subject to splicing that is not efficiently completed, thus contributing to an overall reduction in gene expression. We hypothesize that the specific interaction between these and the surrounding exons and spliceosome is not efficient enough and leads to non-catalytic inhibition of splicing at these sites. Investigation of the regulatory role of these elements is important to fully understand the process of pre-mRNA formation and subsequent expression of such encoded proteins.",

   "annotation": "The analysis of cell viability and the distinction between specific types of cell death is one of the key aspects of many areas of biology and medicine. This type of information is very important for testing new cytotoxic and anticancer drugs, as different types of cell death have a major impact on the organism. The distinction between lytic (cell rupture) and non-lytic cell death caused by drugs is of great importance for clinical medicine. The biochemical \"endpoint\" assays used to date are not sufficiently accurate to determine cell fate, and more precise methods are needed. In this project, we will attempt to demonstrate that real-time quantitative phase imaging can provide sufficiently robust data for deep learning methods. Specific fluorescent markers will be used to verify the observed phenomena and subsequent label-free classification of cell death. In addition to robust deep learning detection/classification, standard feature extraction techniques will be used to generate clues to describe novel features of the quantitative-phasic dynamics of dying cells.",

The decision whether to renew or differentiate directly affects the supply of stem cells and tissue progenitors, including cardiovascular (CVP) and hematopoietic (HSC) stem cells/progenitors. CVP depletion is associated with the development of cardiomyopathy (e.g. BMD, DMD). Hematopoietic stem cells change their fate and ability to differentiate after exposure to DNA damage. This project analyzes the role of endogenous and exogenous DNA damage and the cellular response to DNA damage and their impact on stem cell fate decisions in vitro. Different modes of endogenous and exogenously induced DNA damage will be exploited, as well as cellular models (human pluripotent stem cells carrying mutations, previously derived from patients and their differentiated counterparts) of inherited diseases that have been associated with a DNA damage phenotype, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and its associated cardiac differentiation defects and Neimegen breakage syndrome and its associated lymphocyte differentiation defect.",

SCZ requires lifelong treatment with antipsychotic drugs (APDs), but the most effective ones also cause adverse metabolic effects that contribute to cardiovascular risk and cause structural and functional changes in the brain. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been introduced as antidiabetic agents, are newly indicated in the treatment of obesity, and apparently suppress the adverse effects of APDs. Clinical trials are almost impossible to perform in these patients and GLP-1 RAs are therefore not recommended as standard therapy in this indication, mainly due to the lack of data confirming efficacy. In addition, GLP-1 RAs increase neurogenesis, modulate synaptic plasticity and have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. A thorough understanding of the potential of GLP-1 RAs to dually suppress brain changes and concomitant adverse metabolic effects of APDs is crucial for their clinical application, and our optimized preclinical model provides mechanistic insight into this issue.",

In prostate cancer, compared to most other tumors, oxidative phosphorylation is still the dominant source of ATP production. Maintaining functional mitochondria is therefore crucial. Prostate cancer cells are also specific in terms of biomechanics; an increase in cellular stiffness compared to non-tumor tissue is typical. Although the properties of the plasma membrane with its associated cytoskeleton and the nucleus are mainly involved in cellular stiffness, intracellular organelles may also contribute to the increase in cellular stiffness. Based on our data, a high degree of cross-linking of the mitochondrial network is evident. In light of the abundance of mitochondria and their high fusion and cytoskeletal cross-linking rates, it would be surprising if these organelles, or changes in their cytoskeletal cross-linking rates, were not involved in the increase in cell stiffness. Although this is advantageous in terms of ATP production, it may be a factor limiting migration and invasiveness for cancer cells. The project is based on the hypothesis that the interaction of the mitochondrial network with the cytoskeleton significantly affects cellular rigidity. The aim of the project is to explain the link between mitochondrial architecture, cellular stiffness, cancer cell aggressiveness and metabolism by targeted manipulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission",

The principle of unstable and less predictable stem cell behavior elucidates the efficient maintenance of tissue homeostasis and explains the inherent heterogeneity of stem cells and stemness itself. Using a unique model of the continuously growing mouse incisor combined with modern genetic, transcriptomic and imaging methods, we will test our hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, in vivo. Our concept explains the high plasticity and adaptability of tissues at the cellular and molecular level and replaces the current deterministic view of adult stem cells.",

   "annotation": "Gliomas are the most commonly occurring malignant primary brain tumors, and the course of disease and treatment varies depending on the specific stage of malignancy. One of the key roles affecting the prognosis of patients is early and accurate diagnosis. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of gliomas, it is not uncommon to underestimate the specific disease and, as a consequence, to indicate inadequate therapy. However, despite all efforts, conventional diagnostic approaches still fail to detect microscopically more biologically aggressive foci that require a more intensive therapeutic approach. As even the actual treatment of gliomas has not advanced significantly over the last decade compared to other cancers, there is an increasing pressure from physicians to study new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets that would both refine glioma diagnosis and prolong patient survival. Non-coding RNAs, including both microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs, including circular RNAs (circRNAs), appear to be promising molecules in this regard. The key role of miRNAs in cancer pathology, including gliomas, has already been described in detail and generally accepted. In contrast, circRNAs represent a previously understudied group of long non-coding RNAs that arise from pre-mRNAs during reverse splicing, where the 3' end of a transcript is covalently linked to its 5' end to form a stable continuous loop. Their only confirmed function to date is miRNA \"sponging\", i.e. the ability to reversibly bind one or more miRNAs using specific binding sites, which subsequently prevents the miRNA from binding to its molecular targets and thus repressing translation. Moreover, recent data suggest that the levels of some circRNAs are significantly deregulated in gliomas. Therefore, the comprehensive study of circRNAs in gliomas represents a very promising approach to unveil new diagnostic biomarkers and, at the same time, therapeutic tools leading to more effective management of glioma patients.",

Mutations of human ortholog ZMYND11 cause several cognitive deficits, however a role during meiosis has never been unravelled. Through genetics, cell biology and biochemical tools we will dissect the meiotic functions of BRA-2 and its functional interplay with MRG-1, another H3K36me3 reader that seems to operate within the same pathway, as well as with the chromatin factor HIM-17, for which we have uncovered a previously unknown role in promoting SC assembly.

Second, we aim to assess the relationships between stress in early life and health, growth, and cognition during childhood and adolescence. Finally, we aim to conduct a neuroimaging, behavioral and developmental follow-up of a subset of the BGS participants in their early 60s to assess the relationships between stress during early life and brain and behavior in older adulthood.

While most research in this area uses questionnaire-based measurement methods to determine stress levels and related symptoms before and after exams, the current study aims to measure stress levels throughout the semester and exam period. The measurements are performed using the 3rd generation Oura Ring with bio-sensors and the M-Path mobile application for smartphones, which allows long-term monitoring of stress levels using simple graphical scales on a mobile phone (smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment; EMA). In this way, the study provides an idea of how stress levels change during the semester, during the preparation for the exam and also during the exam itself. We will also be able to observe how the stress recovery process takes place once the challenging exams are over. All physiological parameters of stress will be related to subjective stress ratings as well as to putative protective factors measured by questionnaires at the beginning and end of the semester (e.g., emotion regulation, self-regulation, healthy lifestyle, etc.). Also, a key question of the current research is to what extent the feedback on physiological parameters obtained by so-called Bio Trackers (bio sensors in mobile phones, smart watches, fitness bracelets and fingers), monitoring physical activity, physical fitness, sleep quality, cardiovascular performance and stress levels, works in the stress regulation process. In order to answer this question, students will be randomly divided into two groups, only one of which will have access to objective feedback obtained from the 3rd generation Oura Ring within the Oura Ring Teams mobile app during the semester.",

We aim to investigate the function of these miRNAs by determining their targets in neuronal culture, followed by cross-validation in a model of TLE induced in immature rodents and in human resected epileptic hippocampi.

We will focus in detail on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a model disease. CLL is usually characterized by monoclonal expansion of B lymphocytes. Antigenic stimuli are thought to play a key role in its development. However, in our previous work, we described cases of multi-clonal CLL, in which multiple B lymphocytes were clonally expanded in a single patient. These cases can be considered as an intermediate stage between the premalignant stage of monoclonal B lymphocytosis, which despite its name may be multi-clonal, and full-blown CLL. Based on a detailed analysis of the B cell receptor properties of the coexisting clones, we hypothesized that their final malignant transformation occurs at certain levels of B cell maturation. In the proposed project, we will use single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology and chromatin activity determination to identify the molecular profiles of the B cell matriculation stages at which malignant transformation occurs. Furthermore, the literature demonstrates that the initial changes occur at the stem cell level. We hypothesize that in this case, coexisting clones would share at least a few common mutations that would give the clones a selection advantage. We will therefore use single leukemia clone sorting followed by whole-exome sequencing to identify such mutations. Finally, we will study the functional implications of the identified mutations.",

In this context innovation is seen as a means to transform the sector. However, healthcare innovations often fail or don't achieve wider uptake - even when benefits are documented. One of the main reasons is, that in healthcare technological innovation often also requires organisational innovation and the complex systems of multiple agents, their preferences, competences and conflicting interests slows adoption. Thus, the OPUS project reverses this logic by co-creating future care-settings for chronic patients from an organisational perspective as a basis for technological innovation processes. By focusing on life-style and self-management dimensions of chronic diabetes (Brno), coeliac disease (Maribor), hypertension (Rijeka) and frailty (Torino), we aim at transforming the way public healthcare services are provided through a patient-centred lens. These jointly envisioned future care-settings serve as a basis for Open Innovation strategies that through, an improved cross-sector cooperation, enhance the innovation capacities and the uptake of patient-centred approaches and technologies for better and more efficient services for chronic diseases. By deploying a Societal Robustness Methodology for jointly developing four care settings, co-creating four Open Innovation pilots, and anchoring the generalised, cross-regional learnings on the cross-sectoral interface between healthcare and innovation policy, OPUS contributes to improve the life of chronic patients, increases the efficiency of healthcare systems and enhances the cooperation among innovation stakeholders. In this process, cooperation is central for developing a robust understanding of future patient-centred care settings and for identifying challenges for their implementation that arise from different spatial, institutional and cultural contexts.",

The societal actors will be represented by organisations such as Slovak Alzheimer´s Society, Czech Alzheimer´s society, Centrum Memory and Czech Brain Aging Study. The regional government will be involved through Ministry of Health Slovak Republic, and South Moravian Innovation Centre. The interconnected ecosystems will unite the research and innovation activities focusing on new diagnostic methods and their applications and further interlink academia and business spheres by creating a pilot programme of industrial PhD positions for talented students. The project will generate a joint cross-border strategy covering basic and applied research activities in the field of Alzheimer Disease diagnostics, transfer new cutting-edge technologies into the clinical practise, and accelerate the development of new diagnostic tools for AD diagnostics.

However, many patients develop a metastatic form that is resistant to castration and these are further treated with chemotherapeutic agents such as docetaxel. In this project, we will investigate the effects of selected natural compounds such as cannabidiol on docetaxel response in classical prostate cancer cell lines and explore their potential to activate apoptosis and/or autophagy, synergize with docetaxel, and affect docetaxel sensitivity. The rationale for the selection of the natural compounds tested is the hypothesis that these compounds may interact with different cellular targets of autophagy signaling. The expected results will provide new insights into the interactions between different classes of natural compounds in the oncological context and also provide perspectives for targeting specific cellular signals to achieve a more effective effect of cytostatics.",

To study these phenomena, we propose to develop novel reporters that allow accurate quantification of senescence activation in human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). An iPSC-based model of neurodifferentiation will allow us to address the role of senescence in the development and aging of healthy human neurons, as well as to track this cellular response in the pathobiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). We believe that this study will not only introduce innovative approaches for AD/PD research, but will also help to unravel the role of senescence in the biology of healthy nervous systems and during neurodegeneration.",

Within the specific sub-programme 3 on pandemic COVID-19, the project fulfils the focus (E) in terms of prospective evaluation of immune response in a high-risk group of cancer and haemato-oncology patients with active anti-cancer treatment after administration of different types of vaccines, including quantitative and qualitative immune parameters and their evolution over time over 2 years.

In vivo antihypertensive effect, effect on heart rate, ECG curve and vasodilator effect will be tested. Ex vivo, the ability to block the development of reperfusion malignant arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) will be tested in a suspended heart model. The expected outcome is to validate the functional properties of new promising molecules and their enantiomers with the aim of developing new antiarrhythmic and antiischemic drugs",

The current portfolio of eIF4F inhibitors is limited, and none of the compounds has entered the clinical evaluation phase. It is caused, at least in part, by the fact that the state-of-the-art approaches for eIF4F inhibitor identification and characterization are based on techniques that are costly, time-consuming, or rely on expensive equipment for automated image analysis. In contrast, our novel approach, based on a recent identification by our group of previously unknown eIF4F targets, will overcome most limitations of the currently used techniques. Our unique know-how will allow us to develop a new cell-based system better suited for the high-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical libraries for compounds targeting eIF4F than the currently available screening systems.",

Germline pathogenic ABCD1 variant means a 50% risk for the carrier that every offspring will carry the same variant. Preimplantation techniques followed by in vitro fertilisation are recommended for the ABCD1 mutation carriers.  If the VUS shows up to be a benign variant or polymorphism, only population risk of de novo X-ALD exists.

In particular, the aim of this project is to establish and validate a new model of myocardial remodeling induced by aortic ligation in the rat and to determine the effect of social isolation of rats on sigma 1 receptor expression and progression of myocardial remodeling. The proposed project will contribute to the development of collaboration between the applicant's department and the Institute of Instrumentation of the CAS, increasing the chance of obtaining high quality data and improving the success of the grant application.",

Ferroptosis is a regulated cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation after ROS accumulation. Targeting it can be a new approach for advanced HNSCC treatment since related genes are significantly enriched in HNSCC. The enhancement of some chemotherapy drugs effects in combination with ferroptosis inducers was already described. Focusing on synergistic effects of cisplatin-induced oxidation stress and reducing antioxidant capacity during ferroptosis can increase the effectivity and even reverse the conventional treatment resistance.",

Also, cells undergoing the process of cell death release EVs into their surroundings, which not only affect surrounding and relatively distant cells with different effects, but also carry specific information about the type of cell death that is taking place in the dying cells. Given the difficulty of specifically and sensitively detecting different types of cell death in vivo, EVs thus offer a valuable tool to monitor the response of a cell population to therapy using specific molecules.",

For preclinical studies, these include experiments with natural substances with potential therapeutic use and determination of their drug interaction potential, and development of advanced analytical methods in therapeutic drug monitoring. It also includes the study of the neurobiology of addiction and the study of the metabolic side effects of antipsychotics and neuroimaging correlates of the action of psychopharmaceuticals. Clinical trials are mainly concerned with academic research and drugs for advanced therapies and issues of drug availability and off-label use in pediatric oncology.

It is in line with the latest trends in contemporary oncology, i.e. personalized treatment or \"precision oncology\". Personalized treatment procedures are based on a detailed examination of the specific disease, its evolution over time (repeated biopsies - clonal evolution), biological analysis and the genetic background of the patient. For this purpose, both commercially available and \"in-house\" academic procedures based on molecular biology technologies are used. Data are subjected to bioinformatic analysis, which forms an integral part of these so-called theranostic approaches. Biological material is analysed by next-generation whole exome/genome sequencing (NGS), transcriptional profiling (RNAseq), detection of receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and detection of specific translocations/gene fusions. The panel of assays has been expanded to include methylome sequencing, liquid biopsies and, in 2020, MLPA and low-coverage whole-exome sequencing, among others. The information gathered is evaluated in regular expert meetings - the so-called expert panel (\"molecular oncology tumor board\"), based on which specific treatment recommendations are made in order to improve treatment outcomes for patients with high-risk cancer, such as children with refractory and relapsed solid tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). This can be achieved by personalized theranostic approaches, as demonstrated by our published results. Based on our experience, the personalized treatment principle can be applied to more than 60% of the patients examined. Our current procedures follow the latest trends in oncology (procedures such as \"liquid dynamic medicine\" and \"N-of-1 clinical trials\").",

Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field in which this knowledge is used to combine stem/progenitor cells with bioactive materials and flow systems. However, the effective use of any stem cell type is completely dependent on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence stem cell behavior, our ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into functional somatic cell types, or our ability to generate and influence the three-dimensional arrangement of stem and progenitor cells. The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, (i) the molecular mechanisms responsible for genetic instability and genetic modifications of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, (ii) methods for isolation and characterization of the extracellular matrix and their impact on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, and (iii) microfluidic systems will be developed to coculture multiple types of stem and progenitor cells, (iv) the involvement of miRNA molecules in controlling differentiation and establishing stem cell plasticity will be investigated, (v) methods for forming 3D cell aggregates and differentiating them into specific tissue types will be developed, (vi) protocols for differentiating hES cells into relevant cell types, in particular epithelial, neural, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, will be further developed. The focus on human stem cells will be newly complemented by experiments aimed at understanding the origin and development of the human embryo, which is closely related to the issue of pluripotent cells and the medical applications based on them. The main experimental approaches will be in vitro manipulation of cells, quantification of relevant mRNAs and proteins for molecular phenotyping of cell populations, and imaging of live and fixed cells using advanced microscopy techniques.",

Imaging methods have undergone a significant evolution in the last decade, with the advent of methods such as PET/MR and dual-energy CT, which allow to reduce the radiation burden and improve the detection and characterization of tumor lesions. Not only diagnostic imaging methods have been improved, but also invasive endovascular or intratumoral treatment techniques. The integration of the findings of these new diagnostic methods into the patient's therapeutic plan enables the individualization of procedures in modern oncological treatment. Minimally invasive radiological-oncological interventions not only use imaging methods during the procedure, but as the first of the therapeutic modalities, they can use a spectrum of advanced imaging methods to monitor treatment response. The question is whether earlier and more accurate diagnosis and targeted minimally invasive treatment leads to improved overall survival of patients or whether overall survival is at the expense of systemic cancer treatment.",

   "annotation": "Lung tissue is a very complex structure that can undergo a variety of pathological processes, from inflammation, to interstitial pulmonary processes (IPP), to tumor transformation. For example, for some IPPs, we still do not know the exact pathophysiology of the disease or the effective causal treatment. As far as lung tumours are concerned, although we have various therapeutic options available, the prognosis of patients is nevertheless serious. Therefore, it is very important to study lung tissue and, in particular, to try to create three-dimensional models of healthy and pathological lung tissue in the laboratory, in health and in disease, to better understand the course of these lung diseases and, if necessary, to be able to test newly developed drugs on these models, thus enabling the personalisation of treatment in the future to the patient's exact requirements. In this project we will model lung tissue subject to interstitial lung processes (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis) and tumour transformation. In order to understand the pathogenesis and personalize the model, it is extremely important to obtain human cells, which are the only ones relevant for understanding disease pathogenesis and finding new therapeutic options. Such cells can be used directly in the form of isolation of primary cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells can be derived from them and differentiated into terminally differentiated lung tissue cell types. Subsequently, the cells can be combined with a cellular carrier, decellularized lung extracellular matrix, which recapitulates the basic architecture and bioactivity of lung tissue. This will allow us to create a 3D model of lung tissue under laboratory conditions and use it for research purposes. Studying human lung tissue samples and laboratory generated lung models will allow a more detailed understanding of the interrelationships and functional relationships between cells under conditions of health and disease, specifically the pathogenesis of IPP and lung cancer. In the future, it may be possible to better understand the pathogenesis of these diseases and to test drugs more effectively on the resulting 3D models",

Distorted perceptions of one's own body and distorted perceptions of emotions are among the prominent symptoms across PPD diagnoses and contribute significantly to the onset and maintenance of these illnesses. However, most studies focus on patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and patients with bulimia nervosa (MB) tend to be neglected. Moreover, the neural mechanisms behind the significant distortions in body and emotion perception in PPP have not been elucidated, which as a result hinders the modernization of treatment approaches for these diseases. In the proposed project, we will compare 30 women with MA, 30 women with MB, and 30 healthy women, using clinical testing, self-report, and two MRI tasks to analyze the neural networks involved in the perception of self and others. The first task focuses on body perception, the second on emotion perception/awareness. The goal is to uncover key variables involved in perceptual biases, such as alexithymia or emotion regulation. Furthermore, we will carefully analyze functional and effective brain connectivity within the circuits responsible for dysfunctional perception in PPP. By combining phenomenological and objective (fMRI) data, we aim to identify specific biomarkers associated with a particular type of distortion. In doing so, we aim to offer clues to a more individualized approach in the treatment of PPP. Finally, based on the obtained brain stem model, we will propose specific targets for non-invasive neurostimulation aimed at normalizing neural circuits related to self-/other-perception in MA and MB.",

An alternative is autologous chondrocyte implantation, which treats cartilage defects and degeneration. After two decades of development, chondrocyte implantation seems to have reached its maximum for treatment with only mild healing effects and only in very young patients, but does not provide true cartilage regeneration in old age. Clearly, in vitro cultured chondrocytes did not offer a definitive solution for patients. Autologous implantation of chondrocytes is a treatment therapy offered by some orthopaedic clinics, but also rejected or even suspended (e.g. FN Brno, https://www.fnbrno.cz/kultivovane-chondrocyty/t2388). Therefore, as a new approach to the treatment of cartilage defects and degeneration, we would like to carry out research and development of chondrocyte stimulation directly in cartilage. Self-healing activated directly in cartilage, the newly developed in situ stimulation of chondrocytes should reverse their deprivation, rejuvenate and restore their original function and stimulate their clonal growth.",

   "annotation": "Inherited retinal diseases are a heterogeneous group of rare genetic eye diseases with progressive manifestations causing vision loss, affecting approximately one in two thousand people. A growing group of genes is associated with retinal degeneration, but understanding of their role in retinal biology is very limited. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a systemic, rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy with a prevalence of approximately 1:150,000 in North America and Europe. BBS is therefore the most common non-lethal ciliopathy, involving early onset visual impairment. All efforts to treat inherited retinal degeneration diseases, including BBS, have so far resulted in only minimal success. The main objective of the present project is to characterize the molecular pathogenesis of retinal degeneration in BBS and to propose pharmacological modulation to prevent vision loss. Our hypothesis is that progressive vision loss in BBS is a consequence of prolonged intense ER stress, and that identification of signaling pathways activated in response to this stress and leading to cell death and their pharmacological modulation can prevent the onset and progression of the disease. Because mouse models do not fully match the phenotype of human BBS disease, primarily due to interspecies differences, in this study we will develop a high throughput system involving retinal organoids and pigmented retinal cells differentiated from human pluripotent cells derived from BBS patients. We will then use this tool to functionally diagnose selected specific mutations in BBS and to screen small molecules to reverse their pathological phenotype.",

Survival time is significantly reduced by late detection of the disease, high metastatic potential of tumor cells and their resistance to cytostatic therapy, and there is considerable heterogeneity in response to treatment and survival among PDAC patients. This clinical heterogeneity is probably due to differences in the biological properties of PDAC cells. The global goals of this project are 1) to establish and expand a biobank of patient PDAC cell lines, and 2) to use these unique patient lines to determine whether expression of molecular regulators of PDAC cell response to mitochondrial stress and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, together with mass spectrometric, metabolic, clinical, and histopathological data, can identify patients with different survival times and responses to treatment. We will analyze this complex data using advanced biostatistical methods and artificial intelligence approaches that can help identify key biological parameters. The outcome of the project is therefore the PDAC Biobank as a necessary platform for personalized pancreatic cancer research, and the identification of complex biological determinants correlated with longer survival and response to treatment. The project will also contribute to the identification of novel candidate molecules and contributors to the aetiopathogenesis and pathophysiology of pancreatic cancer, opening up opportunities for the development of personalised oncology in clinical care.",

Although these are relatively small numbers, these are individuals of working age whose prognosis is very poor and the pathogenesis of this disease is not satisfactorily understood. Often these are non-smokers or relatively short smokers, so a different causation of the cancer may be considered compared with older patients. Moreover, most patients in this age subgroup are diagnosed with aggressive forms of lung cancer. The genetic background of lung cancer occurring in patients younger than 40 years of age is poorly studied and only a higher incidence of EML4-ALK translocations in non-small cell lung cancer and EGFR gene mutations has been described in the literature. However, our preliminary analyses also revealed potentially targetable mutations in the genes for BRAF, PIK3CA or HER2 gene amplification. Therefore, advanced diagnosis of genetic aberrations in a subset of lung cancer patients under 40 years of age could help identify new potential targets for cancer therapy. The proposed project will be implemented as a multicentre patient recruitment trial, with the aim of a comprehensive analysis of molecular genetic alterations in early lung cancer. It will seek to identify a spectrum of possible genetic aberrations in tumor tissue beyond the commonly tested drivers (EGFR mutation and ALK translocation) using next generation sequencing (hotspot oncology panel, germline exome, somatic exome, fusion gene detection). The results obtained should not only increase the current level of scientific knowledge on the etiopathogenesis of lung cancer, but also significantly expand the therapeutic options within individualized treatment plans after the exhaustion of standard treatment options in young lung cancer patients.",

In the Czech Republic, the situation is similar, with up to 1022 cases reported annually over the last decade. Syphilis is mostly diagnosed on the basis of a combination of clinical examination, anamnestic data and serological test results. Although serological tests are highly sensitive and specific, they have the disadvantage of false-negative results in the early stages of infection (when adaptive immunity is not sufficiently developed), as well as false-positivity of non-treponemal tests in other systemic diseases, or false-negativity of these tests in the case of the so-called 'prozone' effect. In previous studies, we have shown that direct diagnosis of syphilis by PCR detection of TPA DNA in skin and mucosal swabs (but not in whole blood samples) achieved a sensitivity of 76.4%, indicating that direct detection of TPA DNA has comparable sensitivity to indirect serological detection. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to develop a direct diagnostic method to detect TPA components directly in biological material (especially in whole blood samples, which are routinely collected for syphilis diagnosis). The main objectives of the project are the development of a direct diagnostic method for TPA based on the detection of DNA and RNA molecules, the development of new protocols for the detection of TPA (modules I-IV) and the development of a direct diagnostic method using samples with enriched treponemal DNA. Captured positive samples will continue to be molecularly typed using MLST.",

The prevalence of NMDCC progressively increases with age, reaching 40% in the Caucasian European population in individuals over 60 years of age. Symptomatic radiculopathy and spinal cord dysfunction detected by evoked potentials are among the established predictors of progression of NMDCC to manifest DCM, but there are no generally accepted recommendations for the practical management of NMDCC. The diagnosis of DCM is currently based on MR signs of degenerative cervical spinal cord compression and clinical signs of manifest myelopathy. Innovative quantitative MR (qMR) techniques are able to detect signs of subclinical microstructural or metabolic myelopathy as early as the NMDCC stage. In a previous project, we were able to demonstrate this capability with several qMR techniques, namely magnetic resonance spectroscopy, voxel-based volumetry and diffusion MR techniques detecting involvement at the level of individual spinal cord fascicles and pathways using an optimized \"high angular resolution magnetic imaging\" (HARDI-ZOOMit) protocol. Qualitative or quantitative MR parameters have not yet been shown to be predictive of DCM development in NMDCC.",

However, usually abrupt discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is successful in only about half of patients, and in the remaining patients, discontinuation may cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms in up to 30% of cases. Sustained deep molecular response (DMR) as a prerequisite for attempted discontinuation is achieved in only 20-40% of all CML patients, so most of them are still referred to long-term, costly treatment, burdened with the risk of even very serious side effects. Also, no robust clinical or biological predictor of successful discontinuation has yet been identified. The present multicentre academic Phase II trial (HALF) represents an original concept of a two-phase stepwise dose reduction of a TKI (i.e. to half of the standard dose in the first half of the study, followed by administration of this already reduced dose on each day in the second half of the study) prior to their actual discontinuation, with the ambition to i) increase the proportion of patients achieving successful TFR, ii) reduce the incidence and/or severity of withdrawal syndrome symptoms, iii) identify clinical and biological factors associated with successful TFR, including correlation of previously unexplored aspects in relation to TFR (somatic mutations, pharmacokinetic analysis, etc.), iv) to conduct a unique, previously unperformed, discontinuation study on a national scale thanks to the participation of all centres of specialised haematological care in the country, and last but not least v) to confirm the efficacy and safety of a gradual and, in effect, significant dose reduction of TKIs as an acceptable and optimal alternative to complete discontinuation for most patients, which vi) will result in a reduction of economic costs both for the treatment itself and for the management of situations related to adverse effects of therapy.",

At the individual level, they impair the quality of life of the person suffering from depression or anxiety disorders, and at the societal level they are reflected in high demands on the care of the ill and also in reduced economic productivity. Perinatal stress is one factor in the development of neuropsychological disorders. The aim of this project is to search for factors that are associated with perinatal stress in the early and later ontogenetic period and may lead to the development of depression and anxiety disorders. Longitudinal studies are of great importance in examining individual development of neuropsychological characteristics. Research on the impact of early developmental stress based on cortisol levels in human hair in combination with other physical characteristics that are affected by early ontogenetic stress on neuropsychological development has not been conducted to date, and the aim of this project is to assess the utility of longitudinally observed characteristics for assessing the development of the nervous system and psychological health in later life.",

   "annotation": "Sepsis is one of the most common causes of death in paediatric and adult intensive care units despite modern therapeutic approaches. The term neonatal sepsis is used to describe a systemic disease of bacterial, viral or fungal origin that is associated with significant haemodynamic changes and clinical manifestations resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Conventional laboratory tests such as haemoculture, leukocyte indices, acute phase reactants and heart rate have limits in diagnostic accuracy in neonatal sepsis, particularly low positive predictive value. These limits, combined with equivocal clinical signs that overlap with signs of immaturity, often force neonatologists to exclude sepsis from the differential diagnostic process. However, if antibiotic therapy is deployed only when the clinical manifestations are complete, the prognosis is unfavourable; on the other hand, liberal antibiotic policy leads to an increase in resistance of microorganisms. In the present study, the study cohort will be rigorously characterized using standard biochemical markers of inflammation (CRP, procalcitonin, proinflammatory cytokines), and metagenomic analyses of the gut and blood microbiome. The profiles of circulating miRNAs in serum will be analyzed using next-generation sequencing and correlated with standard biochemical markers to assess the utility of miRNAs as early indicators of the onset and progression of systemic infection in the bloodstream. The aim is to develop a panel of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to detect sepsis when it is undetectable by clinical signs and to predict the prognosis of the disease.",

The exact role of this ubiquitinated protein in the pathogenesis of SMA is unknown and the mechanism of selective spinal motoneuron vulnerability remains equally misunderstood. Recent findings suggest that microRNA dysregulation is important in the development of selective spinal motoneuron vulnerability in SMA. We present a pilot project that aims to analyze microRNA profiles in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of pediatric patients with SMA. This project will be essential for monitoring the clinical response to nusinersen treatment. The results of this study may lead to the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of SMA and the identification of other potential therapeutic targets.",

However, the expression of these markers does not correlate with the success of therapy-transplantation. Assessment of the mechanical properties of cells has emerged as a means of obtaining information on the functional status of cells without the use of fluorescent labels. Cell stiffness is influenced by the cell cycle, differentiation, pathological processes such as malignant transformation or immune cell activation. Mechano-phenotyping is thus applicable to clinical areas - to identify hematopoietic stem cells or to analyze tumor cell progression. The currently used methods for the analysis of mechanical properties of cells are limited by low robustness or the need for highly expert operators (atomic force microscopy - AFM, etc.) and are not suitable for application in clinical diagnostics. The proposed approach extends the capabilities of quantitative phase microscopy by hardware modifications and computational methods for characterizing the shear stress response of cells, the so-called shear modulus. The method is feasible at sufficient robustness (hundreds-thousands of cells/hour), and does not require specialized consumables or highly specialized operators.",

Thus, in the population of 80 year olds, there are 25-30% of people with varying degrees of dementia; overall, given the age distribution, this means approximately 10% of the population over the age of 65. Combining demographic and epidemiological data, it is estimated that the number of people with dementia in the Czech Republic will increase from the current 150 000 to approximately double in the next 30 years. It is known from experience that the earlier the disease is diagnosed and treated, the milder its course and the significantly slower it progresses to its complicated stages. A pilot early diagnosis project implemented by our department in collaboration with general practitioners in 2016-2018 showed approximately 10% of seniors who failed the most sensitive test for Alzheimer's dementia, the clock drawing test, during screening testing.

   "annotation": "Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases are described as typical diseases of the third millennium. By 2050, the number of Alzheimer's dementia patients in the Czech Republic is expected to double to 300 000.  In the early stages, patients can remain in their own environment without major problems, but gradually the risk of failure in normal daily activities increases. Later on, a significant loss of independence develops, with the need for constant supervision and, of course, an increase in the complexity of the patient's care. This situation usually requires the elderly person to be placed in a social care facility such as a care home. However, the capacity of these facilities is limited and many caring families also want to continue to care for their elderly person, even though they have to manage their jobs at the same time. It is therefore important to be able to safely prolong the elderly person's ability to stay in their own environment. To prevent or solve these problems, various electronic aids with sensors and communication devices are being developed - flexible wearable devices for monitoring. Parameters monitored typically include basic vital signs, patient movement, fall signalling and interfacing with the caregiver and/or integrated rescue system. Progressive miniaturisation has made it possible to put the necessary technology into a wristwatch-sized device. This technology has already been tested at our institution as part of the NEUROSMART project, but most seniors with dementia encounter problems with the use of wristband technology. Seniors with dementia find it difficult to get used to new things in their environment and even more difficult on their bodies, i.e. they repeatedly remove and hide the bracelet, which causes false alarms and threatens the safety of the senior themselves. Furthermore, especially when paranoid, they consider the bracelet to be a tool of someone who is watching them, which causes them to become anxious or even delirious. The optimal solution seems to be to place the electronic technology on a part of the body where the senior cannot see or reach. The use of the back area in the shoulder blade region is suggested, with the development of a sufficiently miniature device and a sufficiently effective material to mount it for at least 48 hours. Thus, the project aims to optimize the adhesive material used and the miniaturization of the sensors, to improve the handling methods and thus the viability of the whole process from the perspective of AD patients and their caregivers, as well as to optimize the sensitivity and the data acquisition and power supply method",

   "annotation": "The introduction of new medicinal substances and preparations into clinical practice in human medicine is conditional on rigorous pharmacological testing and verification of the safety of their use. However, current methods of preclinical testing and quality control do not sufficiently assess the effect of prospective drugs on the developmental potential of the human embryo and thus exclude any risk to fertility. As the investigational use of human embryos is not possible for ethical reasons, toxicological testing in animal models is carried out. However, due to significant interspecies differences, it is unclear whether these results are also relevant with respect to human reproduction. The need to expand existing embryotoxicity testing options is particularly acute in the field of assisted reproduction. Here, in vitro culture conditions are being modified to increase treatment efficacy without standardised assessment of the influence of media components and so-called critical materials in direct contact with the developing embryo. The aim of the proposed project is to validate the applicability of an existing in vitro model of human embryogenesis for pharmacological and toxicological testing.  For this purpose, we will make use of a recently published technology that allows the laboratory preparation of 3D structures resembling human embryos at the blastocyst stage (so-called blastoids) from in vitro cultured human stem cells (Fig. 1). The existence of this laboratory system opens up a wide range of applications not only for the research of new drugs and the improvement of in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques, but also for the quality and safety control of products used in current clinical practice. The project thus responds to a current need in the field of pharmacovigilance and safety improvement in assisted reproduction",

The exact cause of the disease is not yet known and CVID thus comprises a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases characterised by impaired B cell differentiation leading to low antibody levels and subsequent inadequate antibody responses. As a result of inadequate antibody production, most patients suffer from recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections as well as autoimmune or inflammatory complications. The unclear cause of the disease, together with clinical heterogeneity, are the main reasons why CVID is often mis- or underdiagnosed. The onset of the disease is most often between the second and third decade of life, and an accurate diagnosis is usually not made until several years after the onset of the disease. The aim of the project is to validate biological markers of CVID and their use in diagnosis.",

In Eastern European Medical Programmes taught in English, however, the number of international students has exploded in the last decade, while the number of teaching staff has not been increased reasonably. The teaching workload of academics increased enormously, without meaningful adjustments in teaching traditions sustainable for large heterogenous populations of international students. This has resulted in considerably high rates of mental health-related complaints from both students and academic staff in these Institutions. As the medical profession itself is notoriously linked to a relatively high lifetime risk for mental health and associated chronic diseases, and medical education ought to equip all doctors with skills to cope with these increased risks in a preventive or protective way, strategic investments must target the development of the curricula of foundational years in medical education which should help transform current teaching traditions into a sustainable and efficient training beyond ESG standards. To facilitate achieving this goal, this project investigates a key foundational course subject Human Anatomy for its potential to be repurposed for the above-mentioned sustainability criteria. The key intellectual output of this project will be a guidebook on 'How to Manage Human Anatomy Courses for Internationalized and Sustainable Medical Education'. From 2023 the World Federation of Medical Education (WFME) will introduce an obligatory accreditation process for global medical education institutions providing a medical curriculum in English language. At present, Eastern-European Medical Schools in this category are not yet eligible for accreditation by WFME.",

We aim to describe the relationship between DCM and the properties and fate of the progenitor population in cardiac tissue(CP) using DMD-specific and genetically engineered progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and the mdx mouse model. Conventional biochemical analysis will be complemented by transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to determine CP-specific signaling pathways of dysregulation induced by dystrophin mutations. This will allow identification of targets for suppression of the pathological phenotype.

However, little is known about endogenous melatonin levels in DMD patients and its effect on cardiac involvement, which is the most common cause of death in DMD patients. Melatonin is also released by cardiomyocytes themselves in cell culture. The aim of the project is therefore to monitor melatonin levels in cardiomyocytes derived from these patients and from healthy donors. In particular, to determine whether melatonin supplementation to \"healthy\" levels (resynchronization) will lead to improved contractile mechanics and reduced cardiomyocyte mortality. The outcome of the project will be to characterise melatonin as a novel biomarker for cardiomyocyte dysfunction and its use as a future therapeutic target.",

One of the aims of the project is to create an online platform for sharing surgical materials, where students and professionals can draw on information years after the project has ended. At the same time, students and academics will have the opportunity to participate in the SCaLPEL summer school of surgery, where they will practice modern procedures and interventions in neurosurgery, onco-surgery, spondylo-surgery, and plastic surgery in a hands-on course using donor cadavers from the MU Faculty of Medicine's Institute of Anatomy and simulators at SIMU. Based on a questionnaire survey, it was found that colleagues from the Czech Republic would welcome more opportunities for hands-on training in surgical procedures and techniques. For undergraduate students interested in surgery and postgraduate students in surgery, the project would provide a chance to practice more complex surgical procedures that they would only get to at a more advanced stage of their surgical practice. At the same time, a great advantage is the opportunity for initial training on the simulators at SIMU, where they can try out basic procedures and then apply this experience on donor bodies. This would have an impact on the increased quality and skill of young surgeons and subsequently on patient care. The students would also gain experience of working in an international team of peers, where they would collaborate on a common assignment and receive feedback from world-renowned experts in the field of surgery after the presentation of their outputs. Experienced academics and surgeons would benefit from interacting with international colleagues and exchanging practical and theoretical experience in different areas of surgery.",

We have therefore proposed a new method that allows repeated measurements of TATS properties (fractional area and fraction of ion transporters in TATS). The method is based on the analysis of the electrical properties of TATS after exposure of the cell to an isotonic solution with low electrical conductivity (to increase the electrical resistance of the tubules). Data obtained from cells isolated from diseased and healthy human hearts will be complemented by optical measurements of TATS parameters using membrane protein labeling and by measuring transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and cell contraction. These data will be further used in a comprehensive mathematical model integrating cardiac cell, left ventricular and vascular function to simulate and quantitatively assess the effects of TATS reduction on cellular electromechanical activity, cardiac mechanics and vascular hemodynamics.",

   "annotation": "Analysis of cell viability and differentiation of specific cell death subtypes is a key aspect in many areas of cell biology and medicine, especially in the development of new drugs and toxicity testing of cytostatics. Cell death acts as a second messenger, influencing the immune system and the tissue microenvironment to ensure regeneration and homeostasis. The most important subtypes of cell death are apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis and ferroptosis. The distinction between lytic (cell rupture) and non-lytic (apoptosis) cell death induced by agents used in medicine is extremely important information for many areas of medicine. Currently, the widely used biochemical endpoint assays are not accurate enough to distinguish the specific type of cell death, and therefore new more accurate methods are needed. In this project, we will attempt to demonstrate that real-time quantitative phase imaging can provide robust data for deep learning methods. In addition to robust deep learning detection/classification, standard feature extraction techniques will be explored to produce explainable data and a novel feature describing quantitative phase dynamics will be investigated. Simultaneously acquired, cell death-specific fluorescence will be used as a control for subsequent cell death detection and classification from fluorescently unlabeled cells. This approach can provide important information about the cell population after exposure to a particular substance, such as the number of dead cells, and distinguish the major subtypes of cell death that led to their demise.",

The lead system does not take into account the influence of the position of the heart and its electrical centre relative to the centre of the orthogonal lead system. This causes a bias in the measured values which will affect further analysis of the measured signals. For vectorcardiograph analysis, it is advantageous to use Laufberger number interpretation, the calculation of which is sensitive to the displacement of the heart's electrical vector. At the same time, interpretation in 3D space using virtual reality can be advantageously used for vectorcardiograph analysis, thus substantially advancing the methodology of vectorcardiography and expanding it in clinical practice.",

During the preoperative evaluation, identification of the \"epileptogenic zone\" (EZ) is crucial for its subsequent removal. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, defined in the 80-500 Hz band) have previously been introduced as a promising, interictal (seizure-independent) biomarker of the epileptogenic zone. In recent years, our group has demonstrated the occurrence of very high frequency oscillations (VHFOs, defined in the 500-2000 Hz band) with seemingly higher specificity for EZ than traditional HFOs. This project focuses on basic research on electrophysiological symptoms above the current 500 Hz threshold in a large multi-center dataset. We will use macro-electrodes in vivo, micro-electrodes in vivo and micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) ex vivo to study the generation and propagation of these high frequency events. The results of this project will provide new insights into the pathophysiology, the precise role of VHFOs and their use to increase the success rate of epilepsy surgery.",

The main objective of the project is to develop new supramolecular systems based on carborane and urea derivatives showing high specificity and selectivity towards key analytes (vanilmandlic acid, homovanillic acid). The basic stages of the research will focus on: 1) synthesis of supramolecular systems; 2) development of procedures for immobilization of supramolecular systems on electrode surfaces with respect to their physicochemical properties; 3) spectroelectrochemical characterization of supramolecular systems deposited on the surface to provide information on their composition, structure, stability and selectivity; and 4) detailed investigation of the functionality of newly prepared supramolecular systems designed for detection of neuroblastoma metabolites using cellular and animal models. We anticipate that the newly synthesized supramolecular systems will play a key role in the development of sensors for future neuroblastoma diagnostics.",

Disturbances in the segregation of homologous chromosomes in the first meiotic division are one of the major molecular causes of aneuploidy, which is responsible for infertility and severe birth defects in humans. The construction of the bipolar division spindle in mammalian oocytes is synergistically controlled by chromosomes involved in RanGTP signaling, multiple microtubule-organizing centers that functionally replace the centrosome found in somatic cells, and newly discovered domains around the division spindle, termed liquid-like spindle domains (LISDs). A family of protein kinases, the Aurora kinases, plays an important role in the construction of the division spindle and chromosome segregation. Using advanced live cell microscopy techniques, we will elucidate in more detail 1) the role of LISD-localized Aurora kinase C in meiotic maturation of mouse oocytes, 2) the interaction of Aurora kinases with RanGTP in the construction of the dividing spindle, and 3) how Aurora kinase A regulates meiotic maturation in human oocytes.",

In prostate cancer, compared to most other cancers, oxidative phosphorylation is still the dominant source of ATP production. Maintaining functional mitochondria is therefore crucial. Prostate cancer cells are also specific in terms of biomechanics; an increase in cellular stiffness compared to non-tumor tissue is typical. Although the properties of the plasma membrane with its associated cytoskeleton and the nucleus are mainly involved in cellular stiffness, intracellular organelles may also contribute to the increase in cellular stiffness. Based on our data, a high degree of cross-linking of the mitochondrial network is evident. In light of the abundance of mitochondria and their high fusion and connectivity rates with the cytoskeleton, it would be surprising if these organelles did not play a role in increasing stiffness. Although this is advantageous in terms of ATP production, it may be a factor limiting migration and invasiveness for cancer cells.",

If this response is unregulated, it can induce further damage to fine tissue structures or fibroticisation of these structures, subsequently leading to reduced or failed lung function and an increased risk of other lung diseases such as lung tumours, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms that control the response to metabolic stress is important for successful regeneration of lung tissue. In this project, we will use a unique model of expandable lung epithelial cells (ELEP) to interrogate the molecular response of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to metabolic stress, and to understand the dynamics of progenitor cell metabolism during differentiation into functional lung cell types.",

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by tumor cells may promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and their metabolic shift towards autophagy and aerobic glycolysis. CAFs may promote HNSCC progression, for example, by secreting certain cytokines whose secretion may be involved in autophagy. Modulation of autophagy may affect the amount and content of EVs produced. Several studies have shown that EVs produced by cancer cells expose phosphatidylserine (PS) on their surface. In this project, we want to investigate the role of autophagy in oncogenic communication. The effect of conditioned medium containing EVs (derived from tumor cells with and without autophagy inhibition) on the metabolism of untransformed fibroblasts and CAFs of HNSCC patients will be studied. Furthermore, protein composition of PS-positive EV secreted from tumor cells (with and without autophagy inhibition) and cytokine production in CAFs with high/low basal levels of autophagy will be studied.",

In 2018, for the first time, a system allowing the cultivation of TPA-related treponemes under in vitro conditions was published. The primary goal of this project is to use the treponemal culture system under in vitro conditions as a source of live treponemes for the study of genetic manipulation and for the study of the pathogenesis of treponemal infections. We plan to study the genetic transformability of T. pallidum and test basic methods applicable to genetic manipulation of treponemes. In parallel, we also plan to study the interaction of treponem with eukaryotic cells and with extracellular matrix components using chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry methods. In addition, we plan to use antibodies that interact with outer membrane proteins of living treponemes as keys to identify components of the outer membrane of treponemes responsible for the structural and functional properties of pathogenic T. pallidum species and subspecies.",

   "annotation": "RNA editing is a key step in pre-mRNA processing. During this process, exons are recognized by the splicing apparatus, excised from the pre-mRNA and rejoined to form mature mRNA. The actual splicing takes place in two consecutive steps (trans-esterification reactions), both of which must be fully completed for the reaction to proceed successfully. However, the efficiency of the two steps varies and is likely controlled by the sequence specificity of the splice sites. It is thought that some donor splice sites undergo the first step but not the second. The splice intermediates thus formed would likely be the substrate for RNA degradation, and this mechanism would thus be responsible for a number of processes occurring in the cell, such as selection of the correct splice site, alternative splicing, or regulation of gene expression. The aim of the project is to distinguish donor splice sites subject only to the first reaction from those subject to both steps on the basis of their sequence. This would have a major impact on the diagnosis of genetic diseases as it would allow the identification of mutations affecting mRNA splicing that otherwise go undetected.",

So far, three types of these receptors have been identified and characterized - types 1, 2 and 3 - which differ in function. In cancer cells, IP3 type 1 and 2 receptors are known to have antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, whereas the function of type 3 receptors is reversed. The intercommunication and modulation of the different types of IP3 is not yet known. Therefore, the aim of this project is to elucidate the communication of the different types of IP3 receptors in tumorigenesis. We also hypothesize that the mutual communication of IP3 receptors may influence the sensitivity to different chemotherapeutic drugs, which we intend to study in this project. Three types of cancer cell lines will be used in this project - stable cell lines derived from colorectal cancer cells as well as ovarian and breast cancer cells. The results obtained may explain the mechanism of IP3 receptor communication and their role in chemotherapeutic interventions.",

However, most studies have evaluated the short-term acute effect of a single substance; information on their chronic effect and the effect of mixtures with regard to possible synergistic and antagonistic effects is still scarce, even though in the natural environment plants are exposed to a mixture of drugs throughout ontogeny from germination to reproduction. The aim of the project is therefore to comprehensively evaluate the effect of a mixture of drugs from the NSAID group on model plants from monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous groups, including their effect on the early ontogenetic stages of these plants.",

Recently, we observed an unusual, potentially arrhythmogenic dual effect of the addictive ethanol and the drug aminophylline on IK1 channels in rat heart cells. Our pilot data also showed that low Ba2+ concentrations (common in the population) significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of the drug sildenafil on IK1 in rat cardiac cells and in expressed human Kir2.1 channels. These effects have not been described to date. This project will provide a detailed cross-species analysis of the effects of these agents on rat and human/pig cardiac cells. In addition to recording IK1 and action voltages (AN) in enzymatically isolated adult cardiac cells, complex electrical activity (AN and multielectrode array) of cardiac cells differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (both 2D culture and artificial heart tissue) will be recorded. Not only acute but also chronic effects will be tested. The experiments will be accompanied by in silico simulations to reveal the mechanisms of the effects of the studied compounds on IK1 and associated arrhythmogenesis.",

Recent genomic studies have revealed that pathogenic strains have evolved from commensals and thus E. coli represents a continuous set of strains rather than two strictly separate groups of beneficial and harmful isolates. Resident strains of E. coli are considered non-pathogenic, but share some genetic characteristics with pathogens and are also characterised by long-term colonisation of the human gut. It is therefore important to pay attention to the impact of these strains on host health. The aim of this project is to analyse the impact of resident E. coli on eukaryotic cells and to identify the corresponding genetic markers. To this end, the negative effects of E. coli strains originating from healthy individuals will be tested against several eukaryotic cell lines in vitro. The E. coli strains will then be sequenced and their genomes analysed to reveal the genetic markers of negative effects of the resident E. coli strains.",

Local activation of opioid receptors does not have analgesic effects in normal tissue but only after induction of acute inflammation. Delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonists are candidates in the treatment of neuropathic pain (NPB) with limited side effects. The role of cytokines and chemokine receptors in the functional competence of DOR in intact SG neurons will be studied in a partial nerve injury (SNI) model in control and genetically modified mice. The role of cytokines (TNFa, IL6) and chemokine signaling (CXCL12/CXCR4, CCL5/CCR5) in DOR regulation will be studied by quantitative immunohistochemistry, western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis, and ex vivo electrophysiological measurements of skin-nerve preparations. The results obtained in the in vivo model will be verified under in vitro conditions on primary culture of SG neurons. The project aims to demonstrate an alternative mode of DOR activation on intact SG neurons, which are significantly involved in NPB formation.",

SCZ requires lifelong treatment with antipsychotic drugs (APDs), but the most effective ones also cause metabolic side effects that contribute to cardiovascular morbidity. In addition, APDs are also associated with adverse structural and functional changes in the brain. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been introduced as antidiabetic agents and are characterized by pleiotropic positive effects on metabolism. In the context of APD-induced metabolic changes, GLP-1 RAs are a very interesting class of drugs due to their central and peripheral effects on energy balance. This project is designed to elucidate the central and peripheral molecular mechanisms of GLP-1 RAs in the prevention of APD-induced metabolic dysregulation. The ultimate goal of the experimental work is to propose a new concept for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic side effects of APD.",

First, we aim to assess stress-related alterations in early life by the analysis of cortisol from hair samples collected at birth and another three time points during the first year of life. Second, we aim to assess the relationships between stress in early life and health, growth, and cognition during childhood and adolescence. Finally, we aim to conduct a neuroimaging, behavioral and developmental follow-up of a subset of the BGS participants in their early 60s to assess the relationships between stress during early life and brain and behavior in older adulthood. This interdisciplinary research capitalizing on a unique longitudinal cohort study provides a unique insight into the early development of higher-age-related ailments and would not be possible unless the proposed approach is carried out.",

Presence of cells with this capacity in adult organism is essential for replacing worn tissue or during reparative processes after injury. Current model describes adult stem cells rather as stable entity having various differentiation potential. Here we suggest groundbreaking new concept of stemness being a fluidic ability that can be acquired, modified, or lost under precisely controlled mechanisms. This concept offers a functional substitution of deterministic view of adult stem cells and suggests an unappreciated heterogeneity in stem cell niche by perpetual fluctuation in stem cell behavior. We designed a complex cutting-edge approach to address stem cell dynamics in vivo on the model of continuously growing mouse teeth with a direct translation to regenerative dentistry. To achieve this ambitious goal, we will combine full-length single-cell transcriptome profiling, advanced bioinformatic analysis, in vivo functional validation including multicolor lineage fate mapping or developing a unique system enabling to observe interaction and mutual conversion of stemness niche - stem cell fluidity in vivo. Our findings will have a direct impact on the rapidly developing field of regenerative medicine and will accelerate tissue engineering techniques by understanding intricate behavior of stem cells in vivo and explaining altered behavior of stem cells in vitro.",

Importantly, the manifestation of cognitive decline is preceded by a long preclinical phase, i.e. the overall disease process is likely to take several decades (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The failure of hundreds of clinical trials focused on AD treatment highlights the importance of introducing new analytical strategies and novel methods to investigate this disease from a new perspective. In this project, we aim to combine expertise in stem cell biology, single cell sequencing and electrophysiology to map the molecular and physiological initiation and development of AD in brain organoids. We hypothesize that specific genes, molecular pathways, and/or cell types are altered during the early stages of AD and that these previously undescribed changes lead to amyloid accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation. We believe that specific study of the initiation steps of AD could reveal novel mechanisms that could be highly relevant for the prevention and/or treatment of AD in the future.",

Even though there are methods available to measure the stress resilience, very few tools are available that would make it possible to reliably categorize a population based on the stress resilience of its individuals. This can have consequences especially in high stress situations such as combat scenarios, where it is only after the event where we are able to assess the resilience - however, to prevent the adverse outcome of the high-stress stimulus it is necessary to predict stress resilience before the event actually occurs. Overall, this project focuses on monitoring stress and stress resilience in various scenarios by by established physiological and psychological markers of stress and stress resilience as well as by our novel methodology for stress measurement. Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience. The main goal of the study is to devise a method based on multiple layers of data (physiological markers of stress, neuroimaging, psychological data) making it possible to distinguish between more and less stress resilient individuals. We are convinced that such a method would have a far-reaching implication for the basic research, medicine, and various other applied fields, including space physiology.",

Thereby, ERK signaling is essential for tissue development, and dysregulation of ERK signaling leads to cancer. But how does signaling activity of one molecule, ERK, defines so many diverse outcomes? Current evidence suggests that the information for very specific cellular responses is encoded in complex spatiotemporal patterns of the activity of ERK molecules - oscillations of various amplitude, frequency and duration, that are only beginning to become understood. It remains largely elusive, how ERK signaling executes the divergent functions during the complex events of organ development and tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that specific patterns of ERK signaling dynamics and their coordination across tissue encode distinct morphological processes during tissue development, determine different cancer cell behaviors, and confer differences in cancer therapeutic susceptibilities and prognosis.",

First, it brings an opportunity to establish an interdisciplinary Chem-Bio-Detect consortium of research groups capable of highly competitive research in bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry. Besides the group leaders, postdoc researchers and students for each partner will participate in the project, which will boost their personal development and contribute significantly to their scientific careers. Second, the research project is focused on the tailored development of advanced functional supramolecular anticancer metallodrugs (SAMs) and screening of their biological effects in precise tumor models - namely determination of cytotoxicity and anti-metastatic potential of SAMs using two- and three-dimensional cell culture systems and using animal models in the later stage. Detailed analyses of biological samples for determination of cellular uptake of metals (from in vitro tests), identification of subcellular target(s), and studies of the lateral distribution of elements in tissue samples (from in vivo tests) will provide additional information crucial for the future rational design of more effective and selective SAMs. Following the evaluation of IP protection, the results will be published in top-tier journals. The ultimate goal of the NANOWHEEL project is to set a base for a structure-activity relationship investigation of the developed SAM and establish an internationally competitive research center attracting prestigious research grants and talented young researchers.",

Our group has been at the forefront of efforts to develop new techniques for genomic sequencing directly from clinical specimens (Arora et al. 2016, Strouhal et al. 2018, Grillová et al. 2018, Grillová et al. 2019). While these techniques have enabled a rapid increase in the number of published TPA genomes, relatively few T. pallidum transcriptomic analyses have been published to date.  Knowledge of both the genetic diversity and expression of candidate Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (TPA) vaccine targets is essential to the development of a successful broadly protective TPA vaccine.  To complement our ongoing DNA sequencing efforts as part of the parent U19 (\"A Global Syphilis Vaccine Targeting Outer Membrane Proteins,\" U19AI144177), we will develop robust RNA-Seq pipelines for transcriptomic analysis and employ them to study the gene expression of TPA laboratory strains we are currently passaging in our laboratory.",

   "annotation": "Human carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX, EC 4.2.1.1.) is a cytoplasmic membrane-bound zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the extracellular conversion of carbon dioxide and water into bicarbonate ions and protons. The bicarbonate ions are transported inside cells, contributing to the maintenance of physiological intracellular pH, while accumulating protons make the extracellular environment more acidic. CAIX is highly expressed in advanced solid tumors, where its activity promotes cancer cell migration and the formation of metastases. It also helps cancer cells to survive under hypoxia and the conditions of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Therefore, CAIX is a highly attractive therapeutic target for developing novel, more effective treatments for advanced human cancers with fewer undesired side effects. The proposed project will combine unique expertise in computational chemistry and biology, structural biology, medicinal chemistry, and cancer biology to develop novel highly selective small-molecule CAIX inhibitors as potential anti-cancer drugs. We will use state-of-the-art molecular modeling and NMR spectroscopy structural biology approaches to study in a wide pH range the functionally essential, but little characterized, intrinsically disordered region of the extracellular domain of CAIX. Subsequent SPR binding analyses will identify its critical structural determinants. Informed by the structural studies and molecular modeling results, the medicinal chemistry group will develop effective synthetic routes for the preparation of selected novel triazinyl-substituted benzenesulfonamides as specific CAIX inhibitors, followed by in vitro activity testing. Analyses of the compounds' biological activity in human malignant melanoma and breast carcinoma cells under conditions representing different bioenergetic/metabolic contexts found in cancer tissues will synergistically complement the whole process. Moreover, the planned analyses of CAIX molecular and functional interactions with other essential regulators of intracellular pH could help to identify conditions under which the cytotoxic activity of CAIX inhibitors towards cancer cells is potentiated.",

   "annotation": "The number of COVID-19 positive patients started to slowly grow in the Czech Republic in early spring of 2020. The Czech government reacted swiftly and decisively and implemented a lockdown in mid-March. This helped keep the number of infected very low throughout the first wave of the pandemic. Day-to-day life across the country was thus affected rather by the anti-pandemic measures than by the disease per se. These measures created several natural experiments which we exploit in this project to evaluate various public policies that would be unfeasible under normal circumstances. In the wake of the pandemic, the government introduced a ban on support persons during childbirth and imposed restrictions on outdoor activities. In the first work package, we study the effect of continuous support during childbirth on the health outcomes of mothers and children. Employing the rich health registry data and the unexpected introduction of the ban of support persons during childbirth, we identify the effect of continuous support on health outcomes. Other work packages involve the restrictions imposed on outdoor activities during the lockdown. Such restrictions can be seen as a stand-in for a potential air pollution avoidance policy. However, unlike in other countries, the air quality following the lockdown substantially worsened in the Czech Republic. In the second work package, we thus identify the effect of a potential air pollution avoidance policy using a within-subject comparison of the probability of acute conditions occurring pre- and post-lockdown with a previous comparable period of air pollution increase that was unaffected by COVID-19 related restrictions. In the third work package, we study the effect of air pollution on traffic accidents using the health and Police registry data. The restrictions on outdoor activities imposed during the lockdown enable us to disentangle the effects of air pollution and traffic intensity.",

   "annotation": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common solid tumors worldwide. Systemic therapy for this disease consists mainly of four drugs - 5-FU, capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The 5-year survival rate for CRC is only 53% in the Czech Republic. Therefore, new drugs and innovative models for their testing are needed. Agents inhibiting signaling pathways deregulated in CRC, such as EGFR/KRAS/BRAF, were suggested for the treatment of CRC patients. However, the success of this targeted therapy depends on the mutation profile of the tumor, the homogeneity of drug penetration, the tumor microenvironment, the cell-stroma interactions, and other factors. The organotypic slice cultures (OTSC) represent a new 3D model for drug testing, comprising not only the individual mutational spectrum of a primary tumor but also other characteristics such as acidity, hypoxia, and intercellular interactions. Derived from a tumor of an individual patient, OTSC is a model of choice for personalized medicine.",

Thus, algorithms for registration and analysis of OTSC images from microscopy and mass spectrometry will be developed in this project. The number of mass spectrometry imaging modalities will be extended to widen the range of drugs that can be mapped. For the detection of trace analytes, inorganic nanoparticles will be applied.

It is in line with the latest trends in contemporary oncology, i.e. personalized treatment or \"precision oncology\".  The personalized treatment procedures are based on detailed examination of the specific disease, its evolution over time (repeated biopsies - clonal evolution), biological analysis and genetic background of the patient. For this purpose, both commercially available and \"in-house\" academic procedures based on molecular biology technologies are used. Data are subjected to bioinformatic analysis, which forms an integral part of these so-called theranostic approaches.    Biological material is analysed by next-generation whole exome/genome sequencing (NGS), transcriptional profiling (RNAseq), detection of receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and detection of specific translocations/gene fusions. The panel of assays has been expanded in the last 2 years to include methylome sequencing, liquid biopsies and MLPA, and low-coverage whole-exome sequencing prior to launch. The information obtained is evaluated in regular expert meetings, the so-called expert panel (\"molecular tumor board\"), which results in specific treatment recommendations to improve outcomes for patients with high-risk cancers, such as children with refractory and relapsed solid tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). This can be achieved by personalized theranostic approaches, as demonstrated by our published results. Based on our experience, the personalized treatment principle can be applied to more than 60% of the patients considered. Our current procedures follow the latest trends in oncology (procedures such as \"liquid dynamic medicine\" and \"N-of-1 clinical trials\").",

Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field in which this knowledge is used to combine stem/progenitor cells with bioactive materials and flow systems. However, the effective use of any stem cell type is completely dependent on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence stem cell behavior, our ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into functional somatic cell types, or our ability to generate and influence the three-dimensional arrangement of stem and progenitor cells. The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, (i) the molecular mechanisms responsible for genetic instability and genetic modifications of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, (ii) methods for isolation and characterization of the extracellular matrix and their impact on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, and (iii) microfluidic systems will be developed to coculture multiple types of stem and progenitor cells, (iv) the involvement of miRNA molecules in controlling differentiation and establishing stem cell plasticity will be investigated, (v) methods for forming 3D cell aggregates and differentiating them into specific tissue types will be developed, (vi) protocols for differentiating hES cells into relevant cell types, in particular epithelial, neural, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, will be further developed. The focus on human stem cells will be newly complemented by experiments aimed at understanding the origin and development of the human embryo, which is closely related to the issue of pluripotent cells and the medical applications based on them. The main experimental approaches will be in vitro manipulation of cells, quantification of relevant mRNAs and proteins for molecular phenotyping of cell populations, and imaging of live and fixed cells using advanced microscopy techniques.",

The subject of this project is the molecular genetic diagnosis of idiopathic PAS by Sequence capture (SeqCap) and Targeted resequencing (TR) to identify causal mutations, i.e. mutations directly responsible for the development of the disease. The identification of causal PAS mutations is followed by the study of genotype-phenotype correlations, focusing on the current incidence or risk of epilepsy, in an attempt to determine the predictive value of specific mutations in relation to epilepsy. Determining the risk of epilepsy for a given causal PAS mutation is important in terms of initiating preventive regimens and therapeutic interventions in these patients, thus preventing complications, poor prognosis and quality of life in these children.",

   "annotation": "The project is a continuation of our previous studies, which focused on the detailed description of the peritumoral zone in infiltrative glial tumors in terms of histo-pathological features and MRI characteristics. In a unique way, we described the dependence of the ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) value, which is a numerical expression of the diffusivity of water molecules on MRI, with cellularity and vascularity in the peritumoral tissue. Based on these findings, we attempted to delineate areas of brain tissue that is infiltrated by a significant amount of diffusely growing tumor cells leading to restriction of the free movement of water molecules. However, our promising results have a limited level of significance given the limited number of samples. Thus, we proposed a method in which the dynamics of ADC value evolution towards the periphery of tumor infiltration forms the basis for tumor boundary prediction. The extent of tumor infiltration according to imaging methods will be subsequently verified by retrospective analysis of anonymized histological samples obtained topically during neurosurgical procedures. Refining the delineation of high-grade glial neoplasia is currently one of the greatest challenges in the management of these tumors. If our method proves successful, it could contribute to a higher efficiency of surgical and subsequent oncological treatment in high-grade gliomas. The use of the method in the differential diagnosis of other brain tumor and non-tumor entities, where rote imaging methods often fail, could also be beneficial.",

These are generally available in a few strengths (defined doses), disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences between patients, e.g., genetics, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, biorhythms, or human biotype. Individualised therapy is an area of pharmaceutical research that reflects such differences.  However, to fully develop this concept, there is a need for adequate dosage forms allowing precise administration of drugs. New technologies to produce medicinal products are being introduced, with the emphasis on the flexibility of dosing and high patient acceptability. One group of such technologies are printing technologies - e.g., 2D ink-jet or 3D printing. These may be used for the preparation of thin polymeric films, which provide good compliance and treatment adherence along with high formulation flexibility. Printing technologies ensure the deposition of an accurate dose of the drug into a dosage form while allowing to combine several drugs or fine-tune release kinetics. Although printing may help to fulfil one of the goals of the presented project, bringing the personalisation approach directly to healthcare facilities has still some downsides. These are mainly the lack of a simple user interface for the control of printers and basically non-existent legal framework for the whole process.  Hence this project aims: 1) to verify the application of ink-jet and 3D printing in the manufacturing of oral films, 2) to improve the user-friendliness of 2D and 3D printers control software, and 3) to clarify the legislative framework of the complex issue of individualised therapy. The main goal of this project is to propose basic concepts and solutions for the outlined problems, pilot and verify them (including their publication potential), establish close cooperation between interested research groups, and prepare the submission of a comprehensive grant project.",

Currently no curative therapy for HD is available, but the field is progressing at a fast pace, with most efforts concentrated on lowering mHTT levels, ideally before the HD symptom onset. HTT plays important, but not yet fully elucidated role in the cell differentiation and embryo development and this may have important consequences for application of HTT lowering therapies. In the proposed project we plan to study human HD iPSC lines, HTT null lines and normal HTT iPSC lines and their early and late neuronal differentiation using advanced microscopy and proteomic techniques.

The molecular by which CILK1 regulates cilia is however not known, and is objective of this proposal. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that CILK1 regulates cilia by phosphorylation of proteins involved in assembly of protein complexes that are crucial for ciliogenesis and regulation of the intraflagellar transport. Using biochemical approaches and in cell experiments, we will identify the motifs among our candidate proteins that are phosphorylated by CILK1 in cells, and determine functional consequences of this phosphorylation in regulation of cilia. This will expand our understanding of basic ciliary processes, and potentially contribute to management of yet untreatable CILK1-mediated disorders.",

Besides the secretion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the epithelial cells of CP form the blood-CSF (B-CSF) barrier, an interface between the circulating blood and CSF.  Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence implying the involvement of the CP and B-CSF barrier in different neurological disorders such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), nerve injury, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and Alzheimer’s disease. However, the B-CSF barrier is among the least studied structures of the central nervous system (CNS) despite its clinical importance. \nOur group has been focused on investigating the pathology and therapeutic potential of the CP and B-CSF barrier using in-vivo and in-vitro (cell lines grown as monolayers on flat surfaces) models. Our in-vitro cell models (Z310 cell line and primary cells) aim to reproduce B-CSF barrier functionality, plus allow for genetic manipulation and enable us to study and control the passage of active component through the barrier in order to understand its properties at the cellular and molecular level. \nIn-vitro two-dimensional (2D) culture systems, in general, are simple, fast, and cost-effective; however, the 2D culture system does not resemble the environment in which cells experience in the brain tissue. Therefore, a significant difference between the 2D cell monolayers and in-vivo characteristics has been reported. Impaired cell-cell communication and reduced intercellular contacts are among the limiting factors of a 2D culture. Nevertheless, three-dimensional (3D) systems can capture complex physiological responses and could closely resemble in-vivo conditions. \nThe goal of this project is to develop 3D CP epithelial cell culture and 3D blood-barin barrier (BBB) model employing tissue engineering techniques and biomaterials in order to support advanced studies on the structure and function of the B-CSF barrier in physiological and pathological conditions.",

   "annotation": "Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is an incurable progressive neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly population worldwide. However, despite tremendous effort, the initial trigger of AD initiation that likely happens decades before the AD diagnosis is still unknown. And while the current body of research supports the concept that protein aggregation initiates the onset of AD, failure of over 413 clinical trials performed thus far that aimed to treat AD highlights the importance of introducing novel analytical strategies and methods to explore this disease from a new unbiased perspective. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to determine which molecules, molecular pathways, and cell types are altered during the initial phase of AD development and use this knowledge to validate markers (and possibly “druggable targets”) of early disease onset. Specifically, we aim to 1) perform single-cell sequencing of our established functional AD-iPSCs-based model of brain organoids in the timeline experiments; 2) use unbiased data analysis to reveal molecules, molecular pathways, and cell types that are altered during the initiation of AD pathogenesis and pinpoint the relevant AD-driver change(s); and 3) evaluate if any of these novel findings could be used as early disease onset marker or possibly as AD drug-targets and perform functional studies of selected molecules. To this date, such single-cell seq analysis of AD-brain organoids has not been performed, nor has any of the available single-cell seq research from post-mortem AD-brains addressed the initial steps leading to the manifestation of AD pathology. Thus we believe that this project could significantly contribute to solving the initial trigger that stands behind the early steps of AD pathogenesis.",

Thereby, ERK signaling is essential for mammary gland development, including, and dysregulation of ERK signaling leads to breast cancer. However, it remains largely elusive, how ERK signaling executes the divergent functions during breast development and cancerogenesis. We hypothesize that specific patterns of ERK signaling dynamics encode distinct morphological processes during mammary gland development, determine different cancer cell behaviors, and confer differences in therapeutic susceptibilities and prognosis. \nThe overall objective of this project is to decipher the ERK activity dynamics code in mammary gland development and breast cancer. To this end, we aim to 1) uncover the ERK activity dynamics patterns during mammary morphogenesis and cancer progression using state-of-the-art bioimaging approaches with highly sensitive ERK biosensors in developmentally and clinically highly relevant in vivo and ex vivo models; 2) decipher the ERK dynamics code by tracking the cellular and molecular outcomes of ERK activity dynamics by analyzing gene expression and protein abundance patterns using non-targeted and targeted approaches; and 3) validate our findings by perturbation analysis using specific inhibitors to modulate ERK signaling in normal and cancer cells. \nThe proposed experimental techniques with cellular resolution, ranging from ERK biosensor to single-cell transcriptome and spatial transcriptomic analyses, hold the promise to elucidate the relationship between ERK activity dynamics, morphogenesis and cancerogenesis while considering cellular heterogeneity. Our research collaboration will provide essential, in-depth insights in the basic biology of this crucial signaling pathway during mammary gland development and breast cancer progression. In the era of precision medicine, our findings will shed light on mechanisms of normal and neoplastic breast cell heterogeneity and lead to the development of new rational, tailored treatment strategies and predictions of therapeutic responses for breast cancer patients.",

First, we aim to assess stress-related alterations of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis function in early life by the analysis of cortisol from hair samples collected at birth and another three time points during the first year of life.  Second, we aim to assess the relationships between alterations of HPA axis function in early life and health, growth, and cognition during childhood and adolescence. Finally, we aim to conduct a neuroimaging, behavioral and developmental follow-up of a subset of the BGS participants in their early 60s to assess the relationships between alternations in HPA axis function during early life and brain and behavior in older adulthood. This interdisciplinary research capitalizing on a unique longitudinal cohort study bridges the fields of anthropology, medicine, and neuroscience and offers unprecedented breakthrough into the long-term health consequences of exposure to early life stress.",

After transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs are crucial to reducing the risk for organ rejection. Apart from this desired effect, the compromised immunocompetence of the recipient leads to an increased risk for infectious disease. Moreover current immunosuppression regimens are unable to sufficiently control allorecognition of the graft, which leads to chronic rejection. Thus optimal management of immunosuppressive drug dosing requires a delicate balance between inadequate and excessive immunosuppression. At present, there is no diagnostic test or algorithm for optimal guidance of immunosuppressive drugs. Monitoring relies on the quantification of calcineurin inhibitor, mostly tacrolimus, through levels in the peripheral blood, which correlate more closely with the risk of drug-related toxicity than the immunosuppressive efficacy. There is an urgent need for tools to personalise immunosuppression thereby reducing the risk of infectious disease and, at the same time, graft rejection.",

The disease is characterized by chromosome fragility, premature aging, developmental abnormalities and predisposition to cancer. RecQ4 participates in several cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA damage response, telomere and mitochondrial maintenance. However, it is not clear which impaired functions of RECQ4 trigger the pathogenic effects. We have identified several novel RecQ4 interacting partners mediated by the conserved N-terminal domain required for cell viability. Here we propose a multidisciplinary set of biochemical, biophysical, structural, cellular and genetic approaches to understand the molecular function of RecQ4 protein in cells and its correlation to disease development. We set three goals to unravel the roles of RecQ4 during replication and resolution of replication/recombination intermediates. Krejci’s lab will focus on biochemical characterization of the above-mentioned protein interactions and their effect on replication initiation and progression, as well as resolution of stalled intermediates in human cell lines. Tripsianes’ group will focus on structural and biophysical characterisation of interaction interfaces and identify separation of function mutants. Silva’s team will nicely complement the biological role of RecQ4 in the C.elegans model system. The proposed synergy promises to dissect RecQ4 multiple functions in genome maintenance, which in turn will offer a better understanding on the development of RECQ4 associated diseases.",

Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience.

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the molecular pathology of achondroplasia, and compromises development of treatment for this devastating human condition. \nOur previous work points to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. \nIn the proposed research, we will use mathematical modelling and advanced computational analysis to reconstruct the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation, and to predict their behavior. The in silico analysis will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling. \nUnraveling the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK activation will aid development of novel treatments for achondroplasia. Because many other, FGFR3-unrelated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) utilize prolonged ERK activation in their pathological signaling, the theoretic and experimental work proposed here will advance the understanding of general mechanisms of developmental defects, cancer and other disorders caused by aberrant RTK activation.",

Within this population, poor muscle control, impaired balance and spasticity cause significant motor impairments. To improve locomotion, a surgery is the key part of treatment, whose success strongly depends on a correct surgery indication. However, the selection of the convenient surgery is very difficult and subjective also for expert surgeons. On the other hand, current motion capture systems can accurately measure kinematic, kinetic and spatio-temporal parameters of gait (so-called 3D motion data). A manual analysis of such complex data is practically impossible in huge data volumes. Within this project, we propose to develop a prototype software application for automatic analysis and evaluation of 3D motion data using sophisticated technologies employing artificial intelligence. In particular, we plan to utilize current advances in deep neural networks to learn a locomotion model from 3D motion data of thousands of gait cycles of more than 500 patients operated in the past. The learned model will be used to find formerly-operated patients with the most similar walking patterns. By considering the treatment outcome of these known patients, we could recommend the most suitable surgery option for a new examined patient. We assume that a sophisticated similarity analysis of a huge amount of 3D motion data can be the critical factor in distinguishing patients with a good response from patients with a poor response to a specific surgery, which is not possible to do in any other way at the present time.

The ability of the solution to capture the changes of individual cortical subcomponents in schizophrenia will be evaluated as well. \nUsing this multidisciplinary approach we aim to increase the spatial resolution of brain anatomy imaging that at current state does not allow the direct detection and evaluation of relevant features of the neuropathology of mental disorders. Our approach should enable the visualisation and measurement of cortical subcomponents that correspond to individual cortical layers. Such resolution would enable interpretation of the disease processes, treatment effects and their mutual interactions in vivo, and deliver missing information for better diagnostics and treatment regimens in psychiatry.",

First, it brings an opportunity to establish an interdisciplinary Chem-Bio-Detect consortium of research groups capable of highly-competitive research in bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry. Besides the group leaders, one postdoc researcher and one student for each partner will participate in the project, which will boost their personal development and will contribute significantly to their scientific carriers. Second, the research project is focused on the tailored development of advanced functional supramolecular anticancer metallodrugs (SAMs) and screening of their biological effects, namely determination of cytotoxicity and anti-metastatic potential at the cellular (in vitro) and animal (in vivo) levels. Detailed analyses of biological samples for determination of cellular uptake of metals (from in vitro tests), identification of subcellular target(s), and studies of the lateral distribution of elements in tissue samples (from in vivo tests) will provide an additional information crucial for the future rational design of more effective and selective SAMs. Following the evaluation of IP protection, the results will be published in high-level journals. The ultimate goal of the NANOWHEEL project is to set a base for a structure-activity relationship investigation of the developed SAM and to establish an internationally competitive research center attracting prestigious research grants and talented young researchers.",

Here, we will investigate lead and zinc nanoparticles clearance after their exposure by inhalation in whole body chambers. We will determine their distribution into different parts of neural tissues and submicroscopic changes caused by the nanoparticles in all target neural tissues, the speed of their clearance from selected organs and the ability of neural tissues to recover. Next, cellular mechanisms of nanoparticle clearance will be analyzed and we will test the hypothesis of ABC transporters as a key actors for metal nanoparticles efflux from cells. Moreover, we will develop and optimize new protocol for dual analysis of protein and element distribution in tissues to analyze direct effect of increased lead concentration on certain parts of organs. This new approach will enable us to correlate lead concentration to protein expression level. Our findings will expand our knowledge on the effects of inhaled toxic metal nanoparticles on organisms and will set grounds for designing strategies to support nanoparticles removal from organs in highly exposed urban areas.",

For adults, romantic partners are one of the most important social regulators of negative emotions, and experimental studies have shown that partner presence dampens emotional distress and neural reactivity during physical threat and pain. However, the modulating effects of social support during exposure to emotional visual stimuli and emotional imagery are still largely unexplored. Negative emotional imagery and exposure to grief-inducing visual material cause subjective stress and can compromise quality of life. Intrusive mental imagery is further prevalent in patients with mood and anxiety disorders and therefore has been given increasing scientific attention. Both peripheral and central neurophysiological underpinnings of negative imagery and whether these can be modulated has captured interest. Previous studies have used physical threats to induce discomfort, but during ordinary everyday life fantasies and images of aversive situations and outcomes are common and therefore in this project we aimed to study aversive mental imagery and exposure to visual reminders of deceased close person, and the effects of social support given by the attachment figure (romantic partner) and a stranger, on brain activity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), in order to assess the brain function at various levels. Such research is warranted in order to investigate brain reactivity and functional connectivity, that are specific for negative imagery and exposure to negative personal visual material and whether social support by a close person can modulate such potentially deleterious neural activity to this type of stressors. The findings can provide new leads in understanding possible health benefits stemming from social interactions and deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of attachment.

We have collected strong preliminary observations that uncover a previously unknown role for PARG in stimulating meiotic DNA double strand break (DSB) formation and in promoting their homologous recombination-mediated repair together with BRCA1. By exploiting the powerful genetics, biochemical and cytological tools provided by the C. elegans system, we expect to shed new light on how catabolism of ADP-ribose influences DSB induction/repair dynamics in the germ cells and to identify the targets of PARG-1 in vivo, a type of analysis never carried out up to date.",

Curiously, molecular mechanisms underlying the earliest developmental changes of neurons in AD brains are unknown. Here we aim to study this process using in vitro model of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from patients with familial and sporadic AD. Our expertise will allow us to derive and characterize a set of new iPSCs cell lines, differentiate them into self-renewing neural stem cells (NSCs), and to mature neurons and perform mRNA and microRNA Seq analysis. Candidate genes with a significantly changed expression between AD patient’s cells and healthy controls will be selected and studied in greater detail using standard techniques of molecular biology available in the laboratory of the applicant.

The project members made initial contact thanks to the Joanna Briggs Collaboration, which is a not-for profit organization and some project partners are members of this collaboration.\nThe SPIDER project was developed to address the needs of improving skills of European project partners in EBHC, especially in the translation/implementation and utilization of evidence in healthcare clinical practice.

Based on the current situation, there is not a completely established educational programme which is focused on evidence translation/implementation into practice in Europe. This means that professionals in healthcare across Europe need to improve their experience and skills with implementation of the research evidence into their practice. It is especially important in this era, when praxis in some healthcare fields lags more than 15-years behind science.\nThe coordinator of this project from the Czech Republic is, together with colleagues from Denmark, the only institution who have trainers qualified to deliver the unique EBCFP, which was developed by experts from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia. JBI is a world leader in the field of EBHC, having developed the unique EBCFP.\nThe key objective of this project is to decrease the gap between research and practice in healthcare and support international cooperation of professionals in healthcare.

Different vertebrates developed distinct ways how to maintain teeth vitality throughout their lives. Unlike them, human teeth have only limited regenerative and reparative capacity and since the average age of human survival is increasing, dentition is more susceptible to variety of diseases which can ultimately lead to teeth loss. Although modern human dental medicine is able to deal with multiple of dental diseases, the treatment is usually limited to application of inorganic artificial compounds beginning with tooth fillings and in the end leading to application of tooth implants or dentures. Currently there is no clinically routinely used method based on utilization of natural biological processes in regenerative dentistry. In this proposal we suggest completely novel approach how to look at the regenerative medicine in general context by performing experiments on the tooth model system via adopting natural developmental mechanisms for controlling highly specific cell differentiation. Our main practical aim is to produce odontoblasts – a dentin-forming cells, which would be naturally able to repair major hard matrix of the tooth. Recently we gathered important data from our single cell RNA-seq datasets (Dental Cell Type Atlas) from the developing teeth which gave us unique information about transcription factor (TF) code activated during odontoblasts differentiation. Adopting this knowledge we propose new approach to prove the role of TF code in odontoblasts differentiation and validate this hypothesis under both in vitro and in vivo conditions during cells-into-tooth transplantations. This approach may open completely new field of dentistry and in long-term scale can significantly prolong human dental fitness keeping our own teeth healthier and more resistant to dental caries.",

   "annotation": "The interindividual variability in the stress perception and associated changes to the stress resilience can constitute a huge barrier to excellent performance in many highly stressful occupations. Even though there are methods available to measure the stress resilience, very few tools are available that would make it possible to reliably categorize population based on the stress resilience of its individuals. This can have consequences especially in high stress situations such as combat scenarios, where it is only after the event where we are able to assess the resilience – however, to prevent the adverse outcome of the high-stress stimulus it is necessary to predict stress resilience before the event actually occurs.  Overall, this project focuses on monitoring stress and stress resilience in various scenarios by by established physiological and psychological markers of stress and stress resilience as well as by our novel methodology for stress measurement. Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience. The main goal of the study is to devise a method based on multiple layers of data (physiological markers of stress, neuroimaging, psychological data) making it possible to distinguish between more and less stress resilient individuals. We are convinced that such a method would have a far-reaching implication for the basic research, medicine, and various other applied fields, including space physiology.",

Here, we will investigate lead nanoparticle clearance from the primary and secondary target organs after their exposure by inhalation in whole body chambers. We will determine the microscopic and submicroscopic changes caused by the nanoparticles in target organs and speed of their clearance from individual organs. Next, the activity of ion channels and primary cilia signaling will be evaluated. Moreover, we will develop and optimize new protocol for dual analysis of protein and element distribution in tissues to analyze direct effect of increased lead concentration on certain parts of organs. This new approach will enable us to correlate lead concentration to protein expression level. Our findings will help us to expand the knowledge of the effects of inhaled toxic metal nanoparticles on organisms and revealed clearance mechanisms could help to find alternative avenues to support nanoparticles removal from organs in highly exposed urban areas.",

Targeted therapy aims mainly at the ERK kinase pathway that is activated in most melanomas by BRAF or NRAS oncogenic mutations. New BRAF inhibitors can delay the progression of the disease, but resistance commonly emerges. Our recently published results suggest the presence of a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism, involving KSR (Kinase suppressor of RAS) proteins and governed by the AMPK energy sensor, that can actively modulate oncogene-driven ERK signaling in melanoma in response to metabolic stress. The proposed project will use proteomic, molecular biology and cell biology approaches to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which AMPK can regulate KSR-RAF kinase interactions and ERK pathway activity in melanoma cells. Understanding these novel mechanisms could provide new options for treating NRAS-mutant cancers and targeting the growth of BRAF V600E melanomas that have become resistant to BRAF inhibitors.",

   "annotation": "Activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) account for at least 10 human disorders, including cancer and severe or lethal defects in bone growth such as achondroplasia. Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the molecular pathology of achondroplasia, and compromises development of treatment for this devastating human condition. \nOur previous work points to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. \nIn the proposed research, we will use mathematical modelling and simulations to reconstruct the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation, and to predict their behavior. The in silico simulations will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling. \nUnraveling the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK activation will aid development of novel treatments for achondroplasia. Because many other, FGFR3-unrelated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) utilize prolonged ERK activation in their pathological signaling, the theoretic and experimental work proposed here will advance the understanding of general mechanisms of developmental defects, cancer and other disorders caused by aberrant RTK activation.",

The branching process enables a large increase in the epithelial surface area for functional purposes to support fundamental physiological functions. Despite major advances in understanding the mechanisms that determine stereotypic branching morphogenesis of the lung, the mechanisms that regulate stochastic branching of mammary epithelium have remained rather elusive. \nIn this project, we will apply mathematical modelling, force-inference techniques from civil engineering and computational simulations to experimental data obtained from advanced, physiologically relevant in vitro models of mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis using automated image-analysis to decipher the mechanisms of mammary epithelial branched pattern formation. More specifically, we will investigate the role of FGF2 signalling intensity, myoepithelial cells and mechanical forces in regulation of mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis. To this end, we will develop and use deep-learning-based pipelines for segmentation and tracking of 3D organoids as well as individual cells in data from time-lapse microscopy imaging and a\ncomputational model of FGF2-induced mammary organoid branching that will comprehend the complex interplay of cell signalling and mechanical forces. Our approach will be highly iterative: The data obtained from biological experiments will inform modelling choices and feed computational simulations, results of which will stimulate design of new experiments. Implementation of this multidisciplinary iterative approach will allow for both hypothesis testing and discovery to unravel key mechanisms of mammary epithelial branching. \nThis multidisciplinary study will contribute to understanding general principles of branching morphogenesis as well as identification of key aspects of normal and pathological cell behaviours.",

A circadian feedback loop of clock gene expression is synchronized by light and the clock protein Cryptochrome (Cry) was shown to mediate such clock entrainment by light in Drosophila. Interestingly, the same protein was shown to be indispensable for magnetoreception and circadian rhythms are impacted by magnetic fields likely via Cry. Despite extensive research, synthetic theoretical framework putting together rather fragmental cases of magnetosensitivity based on Cry is missing, in particular in mammalian cells and tissues. The project addresses still unknown interplay between light and magnetic field on the cellular level under strictly controlled conditions. It gathers three, so far not collaborating, teams to employ state-of-the-art techniques of molecular embryology, genetic analysis and physical treatments to answer several hypotheses all focusing on Cry and other clock genes in the center. We will tackle the problem of mammalian Cry photo- and magnetosensitivity and consequent hypothetical impacts of light and magnetic fields on cellular and developmental programs controlled by circadian clock. The project profits from sharing of theoretical and methodological knowledge as well as unique instrumentation unattainable elsewhere. Due to the novel multidisciplinary approach the outputs may advance our understanding of important environmental impacts on processes orchestrating networks of cellular communication on the intersection of neural function, development, regeneration and circadian control.",

At present, this happens due to punctual clinical judgement or the application of clinical risk assessment scores. The innovation of the IMPULS project is to screen patient´s risk “constantly” through smart wearable mobility/motion sensors in order to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers, hence to increase patient safety.\nTo generate a large impact, we will integrate our developed smart sensor based digital assistance systems in different health care settings (hospitals, nursing homes, retirement homes, etc.) across Europe. \nAlthough mobility/motion sensors are common in sports and life-style products (watches) and smart devices and hardware solutions are already available and very inexpensive, this technology has not yet been adopted to fit into the needs of nursing care. Therefore, one first objective of the IMPULS project is to provide software solutions for available hardware that will allow its use in the nursing care process. The developed systems will be tested for practicability, effectiveness and efficiency for its use in nursing care under real nursing care conditions. The use of these smart wearable sensors allows further specific objectives: \nThe continuous screening of patients’ remaining abilities will enable us to develop a more precise pressure ulcer risk model, because the actual monitoring of patients’ mobility has not been implemented so far. Current clinical pressure ulcer risk models are based on clinical observations and assumptions, that most often are neither accurate nor reliable.\nIMPULS will help to empower the patient in his/her recovery by detecting and supporting patients’ remaining mobility and only support him/her when help is actually needed.

Here, we propose to address this long-lasting controversy of mammalian oocyte polarity by leveraging the power of the new cutting-edge techniques cryo-qPCR-tomography and Tomo-RNA-Seq, that we have developed to study the intracellular localization of biological molecules in human eggs. The two techniques have proven exceedingly powerful to elucidate global RNA localization gradients in amphibian and fish oocytes. Based on experience with animal models we apply these tools to analyze human eggs using the position of polar bodies as a determinant of the first developmental axis. This topological expression analysis will determine localization profiles of maternal transcripts related to pluripotency and lineage commitment, and also identify new asymmetrically localized maternal factors. Our study will reveal pivotal aspect of human oocyte development and may, in addition to increasing our knowledge about early human development, have profound impact on a variety of micromanipulation procedures used in human embryology and IVF.",

   "annotation": "Ischemic stroke (IS), caused by occlusion of arteries that supply blood to the brain, remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. Disruption of blood and oxygen supply to the brain leads to neuronal death in the ischemic core within minutes. The hypoperfused tissue surrounding the ischemic core, the penumbra, is at high risk for infarction over time but still salvageable. Neuroprotective bridging, sustaining the penumbra until reperfusion, may widen the therapeutic window, make recanalization treatments accessible to more patients and improve overall IS outcomes. \nAs ischemic cell death is primarily mediated by hypoxia, increasing oxygen supply to the penumbra seems THE logical approach. In animal models of IS, normobaric hyperoxygenation (NBHO) significantly increased penumbral oxygen pressure and attenuated brain injury when initiated early after onset of ischaemia and vessel occlusion was transient (35 to 50% infarct volume reduction).\nThe PROOF project now seeks to demonstrate that NBHO (high-flow 100% oxygen at >45 L/min via a non-rebreather mask, or FiO2=1.0 for intubation/ventilation) reduces infarct growth from baseline to 24 hours compared to standard treatment if administered â‰¤3 hours after onset of anterior circulation IS, in patients with proximal vessel occlusion and salvageable tissue at risk. The study is multi-center, adaptive phase-IIb, randomized, open-label with blindedendpoint (PROBE design).\nThe primary efficacy criterion will be infarct growth from baseline to 24 hours. Secondary endpoints will be NIHSS 24h, categorical shift in the pre-stroke modified Rankin Score, QoL and cognition at day 90. Potential surrogate biomarkers, health economics and societal impacts will be assessed.\nIf NBHO proves its neuroprotective potential in this selected population, phase-III trials in all IS patients may be undertaken. Considering its low costs and ease of use, NBHO may impact stroke care worldwide.",

   "annotation": "Human inability to resist temptations and to control oneself underlies several clinical disorders including impulse and reward-related behaviours. The main aim of the proposed project is to understand the impact of early life adversity (e.g. early life stress) on self-regulation and reward-related behaviours and to identify protective factors that might buffer the individual from developmental disruptions following early exposure to adversity. We hypothesize that (1) early life stress might modulate the development of corticostriatal and corticolimbic circuitry and increase the risk for maladaptive reward-related behavior in young adulthood, and that (2) preventive intervention focused on self-control and regulation of stress might protect high-risk adolescents (e.g. individuals born very preterm). First, we aim to complement longitudinal data from a prenatal birth cohort with a within-subject design neuroimaging data from young adulthood including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), as well as several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks characterizing one’s ability of self-regulation. Subsequently, we aim to develop a preventive intervention that should improve stress regulation and decrease the prevalence of inappropriate impulse-related behaviours and addiction. Applying these interventions in the high-risk adolescents could help preserve reward-related functions in the prefrontal cortex and other reward circuitry. Effectiveness of the preventive intervention will be tested using a randomized controlled trial. This would allow us to assess the intervention-related changes in adolescents’ behaviour and the underlying physiology and brain plasticity.",

TPA cannot be studied using traditional microbiological approaches since this bacterium cannot be cultivated under in vitro conditions. Clinical samples isolated directly from patients contain massive amount of contaminant human DNA. This fact prevents straightforward TPA sequence analyses. This grant application serves to provide funds needed to finish final experiments for project planning to introduce a new culture-independent enrichment method using methyl-directed restriction endonuclease, which selectively binds bacterial DNA in heterogenous samples. Subsequently, next generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing of paralogous and repetitive regions was shown to be able to reconstruct the complete genome sequences of TPA isolated directly from patients without any biases. Moreover, we applied this new technique to the 26 clinical samples and described different genetics of two distinct subgroups of strains causing modern syphilis.  Accumulation of TPA genetic data will help to select candidate loci for development of vaccine against syphilis. To our knowledge, there is no such approach described until now and we believe this methodology will be adopted by other researchers.",

The project members made initial contact thanks to the Joanna Briggs Collaboration, which is a not-for profit organization and some project partners are members of this collaboration. \nThe SPIDER project was developed to address the needs of improving skills of European project partners in EBHC, especially in the translation/implementation and utilization of evidence in healthcare practice. The core idea of the project is to support cooperation and exchange of know-how within the unique Evidence-Based Clinical Fellowship Program (EBCFP) context. Based on the current situation, in Europe there is not a completely established educational programme which is focused on evidence translation/implementation into practice. This means that professionals in healthcare across Europe need to improve their experience and skills with implementation of the research evidence into their practice. It is especially important in this era, when praxis in some healthcare fields lags more than 15-years behind science. \nThe coordinator of this project from the Czech Republic is, together with colleagues from Denmark, the only institution who have trainers qualified to deliver the unique EBCFP, which was developed by experts from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia. JBI is a world leader in the field of EBHC, having developed the unique EBCFP. \nThe key objective of this project is to decrease the gap between research and practice in healthcare and support international cooperation of professionals in healthcare.

The target groups are: (i) Students in all three countries (1st level: UMF, 2nd level: MU and UPJS, 3rd level: MEFANET and other associated networks), (ii) Teachers from UMF Iasi (42). Two skillsets will be delivered by lecturers from MU and UPJS to 42 teachers in UMF (faculty of medicine, fa. of pharmacy, fa. of dentistry). The first skillset is connected to pedagogy methods coming from scenario-based learning field (case-based learning, problem-based learning, team-based learning, hackathons, flipped classrooms, etc.). The second skillset is connected to various ICT platforms usable to support scenario-based learning didactic approaches - in medicine, of course connected to virtual patients (virtual cases). After analysis of needs performed in the field of (i) pedagogy and (ii) medical informatics, we will train the teachers and use them as authoring force supported by PhD students, in order to create 28 interactive virtual cases. The cases will be authored in Romanian language and later translated into English and French to be used also by international students in UMF, MU and UPJS. We do not aim only at complex and branched virtual cases, as we have already learnt that linear cases (scenarios) are very OK for dentistry (where complex branched cases are contradictory to the real practice) and might be also be very OK for pharmacy. We will, therefore, offer in this project three different platforms (all three have been already implemented by institutions involved in MEFANET): A) OpenLabyrinth (advantage=interoperability and standard - see croesus.eu), B) Interactive Linear Scenarios (advantage = already adapted for mobile devices - see sepsis-q.cz), C) Interactive Algorithms (advantage = adapted for mobile devices, offers decisions unlike in B - see akutne.cz).",

Aberrant FGFR activation accounts for at least 20 conditions, including skeletal dysplasias, metabolic syndromes and cancer. Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a main mediator of FGFR signaling, but the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown. Our preliminary data point to a complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels to allow for prolonged ERK activation by FGFRs. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, FGFR interactions of their signaling intermediates, mechanisms governing FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR signal. In this project, we will describe the regulatory networks mediating prolonged activation of ERK pathway in major biological processes regulated by FGFRs. Unraveling the mechanisms regulating FGFR-ERK activation holds a key to our understanding of FGFR function and might aid identification of novel therapeutic targets for FGFR-related disorders.",

Studies have shown that some inhaler types only effectively aerosolize 5-30% of the contained drug. The project MediAir focuses on which influencing physiological and mechanical characteristics exist and how they can be controlled to enlarge effectivity of inhalative drug delivery for individual situations. Based on current research, which is mainly based on in-vivo and in-silico models of the respiratory tract and the human respiration process, a considerable amount of provided drug components are not carried along to the intended site of impact within the respiratory tract. This leads to several deficits of this drug delivery method including situation-specific mostly uncomfortable breathing guidelines for the patients, loss of ineffective but valuable material, special considerations and additional components for children and elderly people. The investigative question focuses on the identification of the influencing parameters for effective drug delivery and how they may be tested to increase effectivity – leading to higher degree of comfort for the patients and less necessary drug components for the producing companies. The testing method will include the use of an actively breathing lung simulator xPULM (integrating multiple lung equivalents, for example also porcine lungs). Within the project, this simulator shall be refined from two perspectives. The mechanical setup will be advanced by including an upper airway model and changeable resistances, with focus on the physiological conditions during simulation including various breathing patterns, flow and pressure dependencies, based on analysed and annotated flow data from the included study population. The used aerosol production units will be characterised prior to the measurement cycles for particle analysis and reference measurements. The combination of realistic breathing patterns, with changeable lung equivalents, anatomically realistic lung simulation and physiological breathing conditions characterise the innovative approach of this project.",

How learners acquire these skills, however, is less clear.\nOur research to date highlights that the teaching students receive is important in their learning about spiritual/person centred care, yet there is a great deal of inconsistency in how this topic is addressed within programmes of nurse education across Europe (Ross et al 2014, 2015).\nDespite these inconsistences there is a great deal of innovation in the teaching of spiritual/person centred care that needs to be captured, shared and built upon to\nensure nursing students are equipped to address the holistic needs of the people they care for. This will ensure the nursing workforce of the future is prepared to address some of the global challenges that are impacting upon international nursing and healthcare.\nAs an EPICC Participant you will be expected to: 1) take part in and undertake all the activities to achieve the aims of the project; 2) undertake the associated educational audit/review and curriculum development activities within your own organisation (mentorship and support will be provided by the EPICC Partners); 3) attend all of the events associated with the project.",

   "annotation": "P53 is a protein and transcription factor involved in a myriad of physiological events. Its role as a crucial tumor suppressor has been well-established, however its contribution to other processes such as embryonal development has only recently been revealed. Interestingly, p53 has been shown to regulate mesoendodermal differentiation via direct activation of the Wnt pathway and indirect influence of Smad signaling molecules. Such unexpected discoveries suggest that p53 might have other important regulatory roles during human embryonic development. This prompted us to utilize the expertise in our laboratory to explore the protein’s behavior during neuroectodermal differentiation in vitro, using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cerebral organoids. Organoids represent a 3D in vitro model which produces structures reminiscent of the human brain, and it has recently been implemented in our laboratory. To study the role of p53, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete p53 from hESCs and induced the cells to form cerebral organoids. Our preliminary finding showed that the absence of p53 strongly enhances the neural development in vitro and generates cerebral organoids with better neuronal morphology and higher expression of neuronal markers. We therefore aim to explore this phenomenon further. Firstly, using molecular techniques such as qPCR, we will quantify the expression of various neural markers, such as Sox2, β-3-tubulin, Doublecortin and others. In parallel, we will describe possible differences between the growth rate and cell cycle mechanics of wild-type and p53KO (knockout) cells. Secondly, we will functionally visualize the electric potential of the neurons within the cerebral organoids. And lastly, we will initiate experiments to identify molecular pathways responsible for the different p53KO phenotype. Collectively, our findings will aid in completing the repertoire of the enigmatic protein’s actions, as well as potentially unveil completely new pathways taking place during human neural development.",

DOT1L was found to be critical for leukemogenesis of several mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) subtypes and represents a suitable target for selective killing of leukemia cells. However, we are not aware of any reports on a role of DOT1L in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, DOT1L is expressed in CLL cells (in-house data from expression microarray) which we very recently found to be considerably sensitive to our proprietary C-nucleoside inhibitors.\nThe proposed project represents an interdisciplinary (in-house chemistry & cell biology plus external structural biology) approach for preclinical optimization of our proprietary, potentially patentable lead compounds, including their thorough in vitro and in vivo characterization. The project capitalizes i.a. on competitive chemistry know-how: our recently published synthetic route is, to our knowledge, the only reasonably flexible technology for preparation of sufficiently diverse carbocyclic C-nucleosides. Utilizing the newly identified sufficiently potent and selective chemical biology probes for DOT1L and other methyltransferases, we aim to decipher the therapeutic potential of targeting these enzymes in the treatment of selected types of leukemia.",

The current body of research supports the concept that protein aggregation initiates the onset of Alzheimer's disease. However, in spite of the large number of available literature and studies, a mechanism of pathogenesis and potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. Here we apply modern and highly specific analytical techniques to relevant in vitro models able to comprehensively capture all important aspects of the human neuropathology. Implementation of such models to study Alzheimer's disease will allow for proper hypothesis testing and will drive important findings. For that reason, general objective of proposed interdisciplinary and interfaculty project is to develop and apply state-of-the-art analytical methodology to a newly introduced cell biology model to study and potentially elucidate hypothetical mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Specifically, we aim to develop modern analytical tools suitable to determine levels of gangliosides and proteins primarily involved in aggregation. Simultaneously, we will establish an adequate in vitro model based on cerebral organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells, suitable to test hypothetical mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Subsequently, we will apply analytical methodology to the conceptual model exploring the influence of gangliosides on the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Finally, we also aim to challenge the in vitro cellular model with an environmental perturbation (e.g. microorganisms) and capture the resulting pathological impacts in relation to Alzheimer’s disease. We believe that proposed combination of analytical technology with disease modeling using stem cells provides a unique opportunity to bring an urgently needed new perspective the field of Alzheimer’s disease research.",

   "annotation": "Activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) account for at least 10 human disorders, including cancer and severe or lethal defects in bone growth known as achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia. Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the pathology of achondroplasia and other related conditions, and compromises development of treatment for these devastating human conditions. Our previous work at the field, and preliminary experiments carried out for this proposal, point to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. In this proposal, we will use mathematical modelling and simulations to reconstruct, for the first time, the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation and to predict their behavior. The in silico simulations will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important molecular switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling. \nUnraveling the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK activation will facilitate development of novel treatments for achondroplasia and related conditions. Because many other, FGFR3-unrelated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) utilize prolonged ERK activation in their pathological signaling, the theoretic and experimental work proposed here will advance the understanding of general mechanisms of developmental defects, cancer and other disorders caused by aberrant RTK activation.",

HR repairs DNA damage by copying the correct genetic information from an intact chromosomal template, which is critically dependent on the recombinase RAD51. To ensure its timely and accurate completion, HR is positively and negatively regulated by RAD51 co-factors and antiPage recombinases. How these HR regulators function at the molecular level remains poorly understood and represents a significant challenge to the field due to the lack of mechanistic resolution afforded by conventional bulk biochemical approaches. We recently pioneered several cutting-edge biophysical approaches to interrogate the HR reaction in unprecedented detail.\nImportantly, we demonstrated the power of integrating data from these complementary methodologies to uncover the mechanism of action of the Rad51 paralogs in modulating RAD51 to promote HR. The aim of our proposal is to extend this paradigm to study multiple different HR regulators to gain insights into how they work individually and how they act cooperatively during HR. Deciphering how HR regulators work will provide an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms relevant to carcinogenesis and may present unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention.",

The first skillset is connected to pedagogy methods coming from scenario-based learning field (case-based learning, problem-based learning, team-based learning, hackathons, flipped classrooms, etc.). The second skillset is connected to various ICT platforms usable to support scenario-based learning didactic approaches - in medicine, of course connected to virtual patients (virtual cases). After analysis of needs performed in the field of (i) pedagogy and (ii) medical informatics, we will train the teachers and use them as authoring force supported by PhD students, in order to create 28 interactive virtual cases. The cases will be authored in Romanian language and later translated into English and French to be used also by international students in UMF, MU and UPJS. We do not aim only at complex and branched virtual cases, as we have already learnt that linear cases (scenarios) are very OK for dentistry (where complex branched cases are contradictory to the real practice) and might be also be very OK for pharmacy. We will, therefore, offer in this project three different platforms (all three have been already implemented by institutions involved in MEFANET): A) OpenLabyrinth (advantage=interoperability and standard - see croesus.eu), B) Interactive Linear Scenarios (advantage = already adapted for mobile devices - see sepsis-q.cz), C) Interactive Algorithms (advantage = adapted for mobile devices, offers decisions unlike in B - see akutne.cz).",

Our overall aim is to develop a cell based model system that will allow us to study potentially contradictory effects and consequences of centriole abnormalities in different situations.

Four behavioral tests of impulsivity were validated, the use of the tests together with fMRI and EEG was initiated, and individually targeted neuronavigation for the treatment of rTMS was piloted . In addition, a paradigm for mapping psychophysiological correlates of emotion regulation was validated in a healthy population and testing of patients with eating disorders was initiated. Finally, a social cognition test distinguishing between affective and cognitive theories of mind was validated and implemented for use with fMRI. In the follow-up project, the Psychiatric Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine and Medical Faculty of the University of Medical Sciences in Brno will mainly measure impulsivity using EEG and fMRI in patients with borderline personality disorder, ADHD and Parkinson's disease, measure emotional regulation using ECG monitoring, respiration and skin conductance in patients with eating disorders and measure social cognition using fMRI in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the Psychiatric Clinic is developing methods of neuronavigation and treatment using rTMS. Research on this treatment method is currently underway in patients with schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder and ADHD, and treatment of hospitalized patients with depressive symptoms is also underway. The aim of the project is to obtain the first results from mapping the neural and psychophysiological correlates of given psychological functions in selected groups of patients and to implement the results for individually targeted therapies.",

The most important goal of care for these individuals is therefore to cure the disease completely (if possible) or at least to achieve a long-term remission so that the patient can return to normal life. It is therefore necessary not only to recognise the disease early, but also to diagnose it accurately and administer high-quality therapy. A great promise is the introduction of so-called personalised medicine, which allows the patient to tailor treatment to his or her needs, including minimising side effects, while comprehensively assessing the various factors influencing the effect of the therapy in question. Infectious complications are very often part of the treatment - they are even a more common cause of death than the disease itself. Therefore, in order to avoid an imminent threat to the patient's life, it is essential to identify the infectious agent early and correctly and to start an appropriate and effective treatment.",

Although the development of psychopharmaceuticals has led to significant improvements in the treatment of the most severe disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and major depressive disorder, the effectiveness of treatment is limited. The initiative for bilateral collaboration between Czech and Norwegian scientists brings together the teams of Assoc. Wadeley, as project proponent, and Prof. Glover, as project partner. The scientific team of doc. Wadeley is interested in finding out what causes the devastating psychological states in schizophrenia. Her team has generated neurons from specific patients suffering from schizophrenia using state-of-the-art technology called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Neurons are key brain cells that trigger our thinking and behaviour. The next step in the project is to understand why neurons behave abnormally in schizophrenic patients. Prof Glover's research team has expertise in how neurons communicate with each other at the molecular and cellular level. They also have expertise in stem cell culture. Our proposed bilateral project aims to develop a comprehensive platform of complementary techniques to assess communication between neural circuits and neurons derived from induced stem cells in schizophrenic patients. The outcomes of the bilateral initiative are as follows: 3 phd students and 1-2 junior postdoc scientists will be involved in the bilateral training required to: 1) set up and use the neuron-to-neuron communication platform; 2) gain the practical knowledge required to apply neurodifferentiation protocols; 3) directly compare the different platforms in terms of advantages for speed, throughput, drug compatibility, and potential for cross-application; and 4) transfer knowledge, share experiences, skills, and best practices.",

   "annotation": "Recent findings on the structure of tissues and organs, and in particular on the role of stem and progenitor cells in their development and regeneration, have significantly stimulated the concept of treating certain human diseases by \"tissue engineering\" methods. Attractive as this concept is, its implementation is conditioned by many facts that go beyond biology. Of particular importance are the following two: a) the availability of non-cellular carrier materials that will support normal cell behaviour, in particular cell division, differentiation and 3D organisation into typical morphological structures; b) the demonstration that tissue engineering is an approach that has the potential to be scalable in terms of economic cost and effect on human (societal) health. This project builds on the unique expertise existing at five MU departments, which gives the opportunity to adequately study and develop the above aspects of tissue engineering. The first aspect, carrier development, will use a combination of polymer wetting and 3D deposition and their plasmochemical modification with functional groups, followed by iterative comprehensive testing of their properties in in vitro systems with cells. An important feature will be that the cells used will be normal human stem and progenitor cells with relevant clinical potential. The second aspect, socio-economic calculation, will use information on the cost of research, development and implementation of possible tissue engineering-based medical and biotechnological approaches. The estimated effects of the results achieved will serve as input for the elaboration of model-based economic cost-effectiveness analyses. The experience gained will result in the formulation of methodological recommendations for refining the methodology of cost-effectiveness assessment in the field of tissue engineering. Thus, in its entirety, the solution of the presented project will provide theoretical knowledge on the interaction of innovative materials with medically attractive cell types, develop standardized protocols for the preparation of these materials, create a basis for further development of these materials towards their biomedical application and set socio-economic parameters guaranteeing efficiency in this area of development.",

Another sub-project will look for new biomarkers of chemotherapy induced polyneuropathy (CIPN) including the painful form in hematological malignancies - hereafter CINP. In addition to motor impairment, patients with hereditary muscle disorders suffer from a range of systemic disorders including pain (about 70% regardless of the type and degree of muscle impairment). Projects focusing on the nature and pathophysiology of pain in hereditary neuromuscular diseases (MYO) and compressive lumbosacral radiculopathy of vertebrogenic origin (RAD) will attempt to elucidate the contribution of the neuropathic component of pain. All projects will use methodologies and tests useful in the diagnosis and investigation of the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain that have been validated in previous Specific Research projects, in particular skin biopsies, QST, dQST, CCM, CHEPS, neuropsychological tests focusing on anxiety, depression and pain catastrophizing, and, for MYO, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of skeletal muscles.",

Thermal imaging has already proven itself in the past as a suitable diagnostic tool for monitoring the quality and state of blood circulation in the lower limbs of patients. It is the degree of blood supply that plays a significant role in the surgeon's decision making in determining the correct colonic resection line and subsequent determination of the anastomosis site.",

The specificity of the project is due to the direct cooperation between the clinical and theoretical workplace, where the surgeon determines the appropriate surgical procedure based on subjective evaluation, and the thermal imaging camera will provide an additional useful angle of view during the surgical procedure.

In experimental laboratory rat models, it has been found that Paclitaxel administration triggers an inflammatory response in the spinal ganglia, spinal cord and other structures of the central nervous system. Similar changes also occur in chronic nerve injury characterized by induction of satellite glial cell activation, invasion of activated macrophages, microglia proliferation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. The spread of the inflammatory reaction to the various stages of the central nervous system may be via the blood and/or the liquor. Our earlier experiments demonstrated the penetration of labeled dextran from blood and liquor into the spinal ganglion, demonstrating the permeability of the blood-nerve and liquor-nerve barriers to cytokine-sized molecules. We also found that peripheral nerve injury induces cellular changes and increased HLB permeability in the plexus choroideus (CP) of the cerebral ventricles.  ",

The rapid and reliable identification of these microorganisms and the monitoring of their clonality, as well as the demonstration of the presence of virulence factors, are crucial for the implementation of effective preventive measures and the choice of appropriate therapeutic approaches. The project addresses comprehensively the issue of diagnosis of nosocomial infections caused by these microorganisms, with emphasis on optimisation of diagnostic schemes as well as the design and validation of new identification and typing methods, including molecular biology techniques and methods based on capillary electrophoresis, Raman spectrometry and mass spectrometry. The clinical relevance of the agents under investigation will also be assessed by monitoring their prevalence and demonstrating the presence of virulence factors and biofilm formation. The project also includes the search for new preventive and therapeutic approaches for these infections, in particular the use of antimicrobial agents effective against microbial biofilms, or antibacterial surfaces of medical devices. New antimicrobial agents, in particular bacteriophages, will also be tested.",

   "annotation": "The project continuously builds on the project activities of the JRC from the previous years 2012 to 2015, focused on the development and implementation of a clinical guideline for the care of people with non-healing wounds. In previous years, extensive research was conducted on the process of assessing non-healing wounds in clinical practice (in acute inpatient care, home care and social service settings).   Based on the analysis of the outcomes of previous projects, gaps were identified not only in the assessment of non-healing wounds, but in particular in the lack of erudition of non-medical direct care workers in wound management and in identifying the risk of decubitus lesions. The quality of care for people with non-healing wounds has been assessed within the framework of JRC projects, but the issue of assessing the psychometric properties of assessment tools has not yet been addressed in the Czech Republic. This paper is thus one of the first of its kind. The project should enable further improvement of the quality of care using foreign experience (especially the work of Prof. M. Ahtial from Finland and the validation of the scale for assessing the risk of decubitus) and their implementation. Particular attention will be paid to the identification of patients at risk of developing decubitus in intensive care and to the assessment of inter-rater reliability of individual tools. This is an intervention project. The project activities build on the professional activities of the project co-proposer (member of the committee of the Czech Society for Wound Management - CSWM, member of the committee of the European Wound Management Association - EWMA) and contacts with the Finnish researcher Prof. Maarit Ahtiala. The aim of the project is to improve the professional competences of general nurses in wound management in intensive care. The project is designed as a multidimensional one, linking specific areas of wound management - prevention and diagnosis of pressure ulcers. It also changes the perspective on the identification of lesion risk. The basis of the process of effective care is the correct determination of risk, followed by diagnosis and appropriate treatment - naming and epidemiological assessment of the phenomenon. Based on the project activities, it will be possible to collect relevant data, to perform clinical and population (epidemiological) assessment in a specific health care facility, to plan and implement educational activities for health care professionals in direct care and to increase the knowledge and skills of health care professionals.",

For better illustration, the molecule FGF21 has been selected, which is a protein with high potential in health care and therapy of selected diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and related cardiovascular diseases). However, an important limitation for the practical use of FGF21 is its extremely low stability and relatively high cost of production. As it is a relatively new protein whose properties have been described relatively recently, no clear idea has yet been established about the future route of administration to patients. The task of the ESF and LF investigators will be to map the needs of the target markets and the interest of potential consumers in terms of final administration. This information will help the FF to better plan research in the areas of stabilisation, production, and possibly immobilisation, so as to achieve modification of the molecule in line with the end use in practice. The CTT will provide the research team with effective legal and other support towards industrial-law (or other required) protection. This will mitigate the risk of dead-end development branches and will allow the FP to develop a stable FGF21 molecule tailored directly to the needs and purposes mentioned. Work on patent protection will be initiated in due course, eliminating the risk of leakage of confidential information. As a result, the potential for transfer of the researched and innovated product into practice will be greatly enhanced. The concept proposed during the project will be as universal as possible, i.e. applicable to different types of applied research projects. This will ensure that the funds spent on applied research will be used efficiently and directly in relation to what the market and consumer demand. This procedure in the form of transfer of basic research to applied research is still missing at Masaryk University.",

Defects in individual proteins of this complex are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne (CS) syndromes. XPF/ERCC1 has been described to be required for the repair of a number of therapeutic agents including cisplatin. As a consequence, high levels of this complex have been associated with a poor prognosis of response to chemotherapeutic treatment in a number of cancers (e.g., ovarian cancer, non-small cell carcinoma, melanoma), thus predisposing inhibitors of this nuclease to clinical applications. Finally, it has also been described that inhibition of XPF/ERCC1 leads to specific synthetic lethality along with inhibition of ATR and PARP. This principle represents a revolutionary and unique pharmacological target for genetically defined tumor types.",

   "annotation": "Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways regulate a wide range of developmental, regenerative and pathological processes. By appropriate inhibition or activation of these proteins by drugs, pathological processes could be inhibited or desired processes could be promoted. However, the development of such drugs is very costly because the investigational substance must pass through all phases of laboratory and clinical testing to determine its pharmacokinetics, toxicity and specificity. However, it is rarely possible to develop a specific, non-toxic inhibitor of a given mutant form of a particular kinase. Thus, there are many chemicals that have not proven to be specific inhibitors of a particular kinase, and for which much money has already been invested in their development. and other drugs whose development has been halted at various stages because, of the entire family of tyrosine kinases, the drug needs to target only one particular enzyme or only one mutant form of that enzyme. Because RTK signaling is involved in controlling cell proliferation and migration, mutations in RTKs often manifest themselves in the development of cancerous tumors. Testing the specificity of a therapeutic under development is a key step in its development, verifying the effect of a given chemical on the activity of the targeted kinase as well as on the activity of related enzymes in different cell types. Our laboratory has developed a plasmid library of 331 RTK receptors and their mutants that have been associated with more than 50 human diseases. This set in its breadth represents a globally unique set of all receptor kinases on which the specificity of potential therapeutics can be tested. We have also developed a luciferase reporter to read out the activity of one RTK signaling pathway, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway. Since almost all RTKs signal in the same way, it is likely that this reporter will detect the activity of other RTKs as well. The aim of the project is to modify the existing FGF reporter to be able to read the activity of all RTK receptors and to introduce specificity testing of RTK inhibitors using the reporter and the RTK library.",

Infrared thermography is one of the modern non-invasive diagnostic methods with a promise of development in various branches of medicine in the future, especially with regard to its relatively low operating costs, speed of performance and safety for the patient and medical staff. The Norwegian partner has long experience in the use of non-contact thermography for the diagnosis of diseases in a wide range of patients. The Czech partners' workplace is one of the few in the Czech Republic introducing thermography experimentally into medical practice. The aim of the visit is to get more in-depth information about the requirements for the establishment and operation of an examination room and the necessary aspects for proper patient examination. The project foresees the implementation of a thematic practical course for both parties involved, including interested medical staff and medical students in the Czech Republic. The planned meeting also includes consultation and preparation for the possible creation of a virtual centre for medical thermography, which would connect other European partners specializing in the field.",

The consortium is featured by a geographic and thematic focus which will benefit the project implementation in a multiplicity of ways. Medical Studies have become a preferred choice for many women interested to enter scientific professions both in terms of research careers and medical practice as such. Still, gender gaps are visible in terms of vertical segregation and access to top positions (SheFigures, 2015) as well as horizontally within medical specialties. Overall, GEPinMED will allow to dig deep into the many different facets of gender inequalities beyond the most simplistic identifications of the issue with quantitative presence of women in top positions: gender structural inequalities and gender stereotypes embed cultural and organizational structures in many subtle and sometime less visible ways, through organizational cultures not recognizing the care related roles any person (male and female) shall combine with employment and career, biased performance evaluation in recruitment and promotion practices, positioning women into certain sub-disciplines for gender biased considerations, often pursuing gender neutral and gender blind research methods also when it is blatant that sex shall be taken as a crucial variable in research, such as it is the case for studying pathologies symptoms and effects of treatments on female and male patients. In addition, a very focused approach aiming at expanding gender structural change from the Faculty to the overall academic levels since the very beginning will be adopted.",

However, as in other fields of medicine, a new paradigm of personalised medicine is gaining significant traction in rare diseases, where personalisation is defined as the use of both disease-specific and patient-specific characteristics. The range of applications of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) is expanding at a tremendous pace. The introduction of ATMPs into orphan disease therapies appears to be a very innovative and promising approach that needs to be validated in a clinical trial setting. Using the principles of personalised medicine, ATMPs, especially monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors, are used in the treatment of paediatric cancer patients. Childhood cancers can also be seen as rare diseases. However, ATMPs are only registered for the adult patient population and are thus used off-label in paediatric oncology. There is very little clinical evidence of dose correlation, therapeutic concentration or anti-tumour effect of these treatments in children. There is a complete lack of information on the issue of adverse effects of these drugs in paediatric cancer patients. In line with the scientific objectives of the FNUSA-ICRC Pediatric Oncology Translational Research (POTR) team, the project aims to monitor therapeutic concentrations and search for optimal biological response of the above mentioned drugs.",

It uses a direct current product that causes permeabilization of the cell membrane in a short pulse, without thermal damage to the tissue. As a result, it has the potential to limit serious complications and improve the effectiveness of standard radiofrequency ablation (RFA). For two decades, IRE has been used in oncology, but has not yet been comprehensively tested in the treatment of arrhythmias. The targeting of energy to different cell types, and the process of point lesion formation in the atria and ventricles of the heart need to be elucidated. The associated safety profile and optimization of settings must be ensured. Cardiomyocyte clusters differentiated from stem cells will be used to elucidate the effect of IRE at the cellular level, and changes in cell subtypes and apoptosis rates will be analyzed in different pulse settings. New catheters will be modified and used for animal experiments and the IRE generator will be modified and supplemented with ECG synchronization. Selective ablations will be performed in porcine pulmonary vein ostia, atria and ventricles, and the effect of ablation on the conduction system and other tissues (esophagus, n. phrenicus) will be evaluated.",

However, the safety, specificity and efficacy of transdifferentiation must be addressed. In this project, we propose to develop and optimize a cardiac fibroblast transdifferentiation protocol based on local application of transdifferentiation factors and local reversible electroporation (RE) using a heart model generated from human pluripotent stem cells. We further plan to use the new protocol to improve and monitor long-term regeneration of a porcine model of myocardial infarction in situ by localizing transdifferentiation factors and RE energy to the affected site.",

   "annotation": "The Czech Republic ranks first in the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). More than 50% of patients with CRC are diagnosed with liver metastases (liver metastases). Patients with synchronous metastases have worse survival outcomes. Surgical treatment is the only potentially curative treatment with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%. Less than 10% of patients with synchronous JMCC undergo liver resection. The traditional treatment approach (primary first approach) is to remove the primary tumour in the first instance and resect the metastases after systemic treatment. The disadvantage is the time delay from the diagnosis of JMCC to their resection. An initially resectable lesion may become unresectable. Simultaneous resection of the primary tumor and liver metastases is burdened with higher perioperative mortality. In the last decade, another approach has emerged with the intention of increasing the resectability of JMCC - liver first approach (LFA). In this case, neoadjuvant systemic therapy is followed by liver resection. This is followed by adjuvant systemic therapy and finally resection of the primary tumour. Randomized trials describing LFA and data with overall survival are lacking.",

Acute intestinal ischemia (acute mesenteric ischemia - AMI) is one of the most serious. The reported incidence of AMI after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) resection is 3% for elective and up to 60% for emergent procedures, with a mortality rate of up to 90%. Early detection of AMI is absolutely essential to initiate treatment while the condition is still reversible. Clinical diagnosis of AMI is very difficult, and there is no specific laboratory marker. Diagnostic imaging methods are limited by sensitivity and specificity. Angiography and colonoscopy are invasive, limited in availability and not always feasible. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and microRNA are new technologies potentially suitable for early diagnosis of AMI. Changes in the concentrations of these markers in response to ischemic insults have already been described for other organs. We believe that kinetic analysis of IMA and circulating microRNA concentrations allows monitoring of tissue ischemia after aortic reconstruction and potentially early diagnosis of AMI. Aims of the project:To describe the dynamics of IMA and microRNA concentrations after abdominal aortic procedures, correlate with conventional biomarkers, non-invasive imaging and clinical findings, and propose a prospective clinical trial design to validate the utility of these technologies for early diagnosis of AMI.",

This remodeling or deregulation of Ca2+ signaling pathways may represent a mechanism by which cancer cells resist systemic anti-tumor defense mechanisms. Thus, the aim of this project is to study changes in gene expression of Ca2+ transport systems in clear cell carcinoma samples compared to healthy kidney tissue.

The aim of this project is to develop a novel, highly reliable and efficient molecular typing system targeting sequences encoding proteomic differences between TPA strains that may account for differences in clinical presentation. The discriminatory power of the typing system will be tested on genetically distinct clinical isolates and samples from different locations around the world. Knowledge of the genetic basis of current clinical TPA strains is also essential for ongoing efforts to develop a syphilis vaccine. The application of the new typing system to clinical strains from the Czech Republic will provide information on the diversity and representation of individual TPA genotypes in our country.

However, the current lifestyle of adolescents - smoking, excessive energy intake through inappropriate diet, low level of physical activity - significantly contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome and its consequences. The problem is how to effectively provide this group with adequate information and motivate them to change their attitudes and behaviour in a positive way. A simulation of the consequences of metabolic syndrome and smoking will be used to increase the attractiveness of the issue. Overweight will be simulated by means of a weighted vest, and a tool for simulating the deterioration of respiratory function will be developed as part of the project.

Much effort has also been devoted to the development of a panel of prognostic markers, but unfortunately none of them provides sufficiently accurate diagnostic and prognostic information and does not allow prediction of response to a specific treatment regimen. This project, through a unique multidisciplinary approach, aims to uncover specific chemical spectral patterns in the plasma of peripheral blood and bone marrow of MM patients which, together with their genetic, clinical and histopathological profile, will be used to create a predictive tool based on advanced mathematics and chemometrics including machine learning and artificial intelligence methods.

One of the most common factors that lead to HF is heterogeneous structural changes in heart tissue caused by myocardial ischemia or other cardiac disease, which result in so called dyssynchrony between right and left ventriclesor between particular parts of left ventricle. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is a powerful tool for improving the symptoms and reducing mortality in patients with HF. Depending on the character and severity of heart electromechanical abnormality, different treatment techniques can be applied, one of them is electrical stimulation. However, some limitations of electrical pacing cannot be removed because of principle of the approach itself. Alternative stimulation techniques based on UV or visible light illumination in combination with genetic modification of the tissue (so called optogenetics), high-intensity ultrasound pulses, and infra-red laser illumination have been examined under experimental conditions and most recently in human in case of ultrasound-based CRT. In contrast to the electrical pacing, the optical approaches would provide some important benefits such as: high precision of stimuli localization and, hence, more physiological pacing and reduction of the affecting the nearby tissue, absence of pacing artefact in ECG which is important for performing of analysis of QRS complexes or ST segments and, finally, possible recording of the heart electrical activity in close proximity to stimulated area which would be useful for improvement of today's and development of new diagnostic, treatment, or surgical techniques.",

Recent studies revealed increased expression of various H2S producing enzymes in various cancer cell types, which points to a new role of H2S in the pathophysiology of cancer. However, exogenous H2S plays important and specific roles in many physiological and pathological activities as well. Its effect is dose dependent. At low concentrations, H2S shows cytoprotective effects while at high concentrations H2S has cytotoxic effects, such as stimulating apoptosis and cell death. Slow sulfide donor GYY4137 significantly induced death in some cancer cells by decreasing glycolysis and lactate overproduction. Thus, GYY4137 administration can be considered a novel and selective anti-cancer strategy.

Recent findings show the important role of the activated MAPK pathway in the reprogramming of energy metabolism of cancer cells, suggesting new therapeutic targets. However, our preliminary results suggest the presence of a previously unknown feedback mechanism mediating ERK MAPK pathway activation in response to metabolic stress in NRAS- as well as in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells.

A number of these substances are known to exert certain cardiovascular side effects. However, detailed explanation how these adverse effects are mediated is often missing. Numerous antipsychotics used routinely in clinical practice are characterized by multiple-receptor binding. However, despite the enormous effort is given to develop innovative treatment strategies for psychoses such as schizophrenia, the currently used antipsychotics still exert their effect mainly via dopaminergic activity and both \"classical\" as well as atypical antipsychotics block D2 receptors. Therefore a deep understanding of D2 receptor family crosstalk with other receptor systems might help to preventing the adverse effects of currently used antipsychotic treatment. Results of this proposal might enlighten the role of D2 receptors in the heart physiology, where much less information about their role(s) is available at present. Moreover, it should be emphasized that a highly translational neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia will be involved in this project which enables to study abovementioned aims both in healthy and diseased biomodels.",

We aim to demonstrate that chronic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of RA, that the frequency of some changes increases with the clinical stage of RA (Charachon stage II-III), and that disruption of basement membrane continuity is not typical of RA.",

HR is initiated by the formation of a RAD51 helical nucleoprotein filament on single stranded DNA, which is able to search for and invade homologous duplex DNA to form a joint molecule. Although, RAD51 is unable to work alone and is reliant on co-factors (BRCA2 and RAD51 paralogs,) to drive the HR reaction to completion a mechanistic understanding of how this is achieved is unclear. This proposal will bring together the unique expertise to investigate how the properties of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament are modulated by HR co-factors. Through the integration of real-time kinetic measurements, microscale thermophoresis, single molecule and structural visualization studies, conformational dynamics, and validation in biological systems we will provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms by which HR co-factors impact on the HR reaction and its relevance to development of cancer.",

The effect of lignans will be studied in resistant cancer cell lines with increased expression of ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein. Experiments will focus on fractionation of lignan-containing extracts from the Schisandra chinensis plant according to their ability to enhance the accumulation of the cytostatic doxorubicin in resistant tumor cells. For efficient analysis of structurally very close lignans, methods based on 1D and 2D capillary HPLC will be developed. Isolation of lignans from plant material based on their ability to inhibit P-glycoprotein and semi-synthetic modification of lignans will allow for more active derivatives and the identification of key structural requirements necessary for effective P-glycoprotein inhibition.",

In contrast, the consequences and extent of ion-concentration changes in extracellular spaces involving t-tubules during pathological conditions affecting the function of the membrane transport system remain unresolved. We hypothesize that during metabolic inhibition, ion-concentration changes in extracellular compartments may affect cellular activity to a much greater extent than under physiological conditions, primarily due to activation of the ATP-sensitive K+ current IK,ATP and subsequent extracellular K+ accumulation. The aim of this project is to investigate the effects of ion-concentration changes in extracellular compartments on cellular electrical activity and transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ ions during metabolic inhibition by means of cellular mathematical models supplemented with new experimental data.",

The second-line drugs are the much more effective higher-generation TKi (dasatinib and nilotinib, or ponatinib). Especially nilotinib but also ponatinib show cardio- and vasculotoxic effects. CML is mainly diagnosed in elderly patients. In this age group there is a higher incidence of hypertension, therefore the coincidence of hypertension and cardio-/vasculotoxicity induced by TKi is more likely. The aim of this project is to investigate a number of factors associated with cardio- and vasculotoxicity in in vitro experiments in order to determine the role of ER stress and autophagy/apoptosis, using a comprehensive approach. Determination of these mechanisms is essential for designing a feasible prevention, but also for early diagnosis and further therapy strategy.",

To protect the genome, hPSCs have increased base excision DNA repair (BER) and homologous recombination (HR) activity, while the activity of non-homologous DNA end joining and microhomology-based alternative splicing (MMEJ) remains constant. Our hypothesis proposes that clusters of oxidative damage to DNA bases are converted via BER into double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are further repaired error-free by rapid MMEJ, while pluripotency-controlling proteins cooperate to protect DNA ends from HR and NHEJ. Adapted hPSCs, also use this combination of pathways to repair DSBs induced by increased replicative stress. The result is misrepair and increased mutation frequency of hPSCs. The aim of this project is to test this hypothesis and to show that chemical redirection of double-strand break repair from MMEJ to HR in adapted hPSCs can reduce mutation frequency, allowing longer and more efficient cultivation of pluripotent stem cells.",

Because each cell responds to many different stimuli simultaneously, there must be specific intracellular mechanisms of RTK signaling that allow cells to respond precisely to their environment. Detailed characterization of these mechanisms is one of the major challenges of modern biology. Recent findings demonstrate that unrelated RTKs can interact and activate (transactivate) each other. Although these unusual RTK interactions play an important role in the mechanisms of RTK function in the organism, they remain the least understood area of RTK signaling to date. The aim of the proposed project is to identify most of the existing transactivations between human RTKs. We will then define the molecular mechanisms of RTK transactivations and determine the functional consequences of transactivations for RTK signaling in cells. Characterization of RTK transactivations will deepen the fundamental understanding of RTK function and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of tumors caused by pathological RTK signaling.",

Pathological activation of FGFR leads to more than 20 diseases such as growth disorders, metabolic syndromes and tumors. Sustained activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway is known to be a major mediator of FGFR function in the cell, although the mechanism of this phenomenon is still unclear. Our preliminary experiments point to complex protein regulatory networks that function at multiple levels and enable sustained activation of the ERK pathway by FGFR. These include mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, FGFR interaction with members of their signaling complexes, mechanisms regulating FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in FGFR inhibition. The goal of this project is to describe the mechanisms enabling sustained activation of the ERK pathway in the major FGFR-regulated processes in the organism. Elucidating the mechanisms regulating FGFR-ERK signalling is key to understanding the underlying processes of FGFR function and will help identify new therapeutic approaches to treat diseases caused by FGFR deregulation.",

   "annotation": "Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways regulate a wide range of developmental, regenerative and pathological processes. By appropriate inhibition or activation of these proteins by drugs, pathological processes could be inhibited or desired processes could be promoted. However, the development of such drugs is very costly, because from the whole family of tyrosine kinases, the drug needs to target only one specific enzyme or only one mutant form of it. Because RTK signaling is involved in controlling cell proliferation and migration, mutations in RTKs often manifest themselves in the development of cancerous tumors. Testing the specificity of a therapeutic under development is a key step in its development, verifying the effect of a given chemical on the activity of the targeted kinase as well as on the activity of related enzymes in different cell types. Our laboratory has developed a plasmid library of 331 RTK receptors and their mutants that have been associated with more than 50 human diseases. This set in its breadth represents a globally unique set of all receptor kinases on which the specificity of potential therapeutics can be tested. We have also developed a luciferase reporter to read out the activity of one RTK signaling pathway, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway. Since almost all RTKs signal in the same way, it is likely that this reporter will detect the activity of other RTKs as well. The aim of the project is to modify the existing FGF reporter to be able to read the activity of all RTK receptors and to introduce specificity testing of RTK inhibitors using the reporter and the RTK library.",

   "annotation": "The practical application of cell technologies, i.e. the application of different cell types and their products for use in human medicine, pharmaceutical industry or tissue and cell banks, is highly dependent on the stability of in vitro cell cultures. Rigorous quality control of cell technologies is essential for safety, efficacy or product quality. This includes, in particular, (a) checking cell identity (avoiding contamination with similar cell types), (b) minimising changes in genotype (karyotype) and phenotype in culture (e.g. loss of pluripotency) or (c) testing the stability of the cell product (batch-to-batch variability). Due to the rapid development of technologies that have until recently been limited to experimental use, the procedures for quality verification of cell-based technologies are not yet well defined by regulatory authorities (e.g. the State Institute for Drug Control). Quality control is usually based only on karyotyping, identification of hypervariable genomic segments or analysis of a few specific markers that do not reveal e.g. global phenotypic shifts. In recent years, we have developed a method combining mass spectrometry of intact cells (Intact Cell MALDI-TOF MS) and analysis of specific spectral patterns and their discrimination using advanced mathematical methods (e.g. artificial intelligence - artificial neural networks and non-linear analysis). The principle of the method is the assumption that any change that occurs in the cells will be reflected in a spectral pattern that we are able to record, recognize and evaluate based on a reference database. This method is a unique methodological approach with the necessary sensitivity and high quantitative discrimination capability in human cells and is capable of implementation in various applications using cellular technologies.",

Results of this type have good application potential given the mass use of cryopreserved embryos. The aim of the present project is to validate the knowledge gained from animal model studies in human embryos. For this purpose, the non-invasive methods of embryo evaluation that have been developed in the CAR embryology laboratory in the past years will be used.

   "annotation": "Zinc is one of the key elements necessary for the existence of living organisms. Deregulation in its uptake and transport at the level of the organism and individual tissues and cells is associated with the existence of a number of pathological conditions. Breast cancer tumour tissue contains significantly increased concentrations of zinc ions compared to normal tissue. This phenomenon is associated with deregulation of the expression/activity of proteins that control its transport and homeostasis. Literature data and our preliminary results show that increased intracellular Zn concentration affects the aggressiveness of cancer cells and their sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our preliminary results also suggest the involvement of Zn transporters ZIP4 and ZIP13 in the process of metastatic dissemination. The aim of this present project is to assess the importance of the adaptive processes of breast cancer cells to elevated Zn ion concentrations in the regulation of their growth, metastatic activity and chemosensitivity and to evaluate the importance of ZIP4 and ZIP13 transporters in these processes.  To achieve these goals, an interdisciplinary team was formed including expertise in molecular biology, tissue culture, imaging methods, in vivo breast cancer models, and chemical analysis of Zn ion distribution in tumor tissues. We believe that the results of this project will help to elucidate the mechanism of involvement of zinc ions in the regulation of cancer progression.",

The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, (i) the molecular mechanisms responsible for the genetic instability of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, (ii) methods for isolation and characterization of the extracellular matrix and their impact on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, (iii) microfluidic approaches and systems to coculture multiple stem and progenitor cell types will be developed, (iv) the involvement of miRNA molecules in driving differentiation and establishing stem cell plasticity will be investigated, and (v) protocols for differentiation of hES cells into relevant cell types, in particular lung epithelial and odontogenic lineages, will be further developed. The main experimental approaches will be in vitro manipulation of cells, imaging of live and fixed cells with advanced microscopy techniques, and quantification of relevant mRNAs and proteins for molecular phenotyping of cell populations.",

In this project, we plan to study the human microbiome in primary antibody immune deficiencies, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and selective IgA deficiency (IgAD). In both diseases, IgA production is seriously affected. Since IgA is the dominant mucosal immunoglobulin and plays a central role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, it is expected that i) the gut microbiome reflects changes in host mucosal immune system. In addition, since there is a significant portion of patients without clinical symptoms or with very mild symptoms, it is likely that ii) the microbiome composition is of importance in these inapparent disease cases. To determine microbiome composition, 16S rRNA gene sequences from the gut microbiome will be examined in all DNA samples (n =50) isolated from patients and healthy controls. In addition, analysis of gut metagenome by whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing and subsequent analysis of gut metabolome will be performed in 6-10 samples previously characterized by the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. This will allow characterization of microbial communities present in the samples and determination of alpha and beta diversity of the samples. In addition, functional characterization of human microbiome will be performed together with determination of the host's metabolome in a number of selected samples.",

The Centre for Biomedical Image Analysis of the Faculty of Informatics has extensive experience in two main parts of the present project. The first is the preparation, cultivation and subsequent differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which nowadays occupy one of the primary source cultures for the controlled repair of human tissues and organs. The second area is the automated analysis of biomedical images, including the development and implementation of new algorithms in functional software. The Department of Physical Electronics of the Faculty of Science and the Centre for Advanced Nanotechnologies and Microtechnologies (CEITEC) are among the major centres addressing the development of new types of nanoparticles with different physicochemical properties. The Department of Histology and Embryology of the Faculty of Medicine has unique experience in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at a scale that allows to gain new insights into the interaction of nanoparticles at the level of cellular nanostructures. The aim of the project is to determine the biological properties (short- and long-term toxicity) of different types of coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, then to describe their interactions at the level of cellular nanostructures and to develop a software tool that will allow real-time and spatial (4D) tracking of nanoparticles as they penetrate cell cultures in fluidized systems with varying magnetic field strengths. The project will result in clearly described biological characteristics of new types of nanoparticles prepared by a unique plasmochemical synthesis method and a software tool to track their utilization. The expected biological findings should be relevant for applications in tissue engineering, where magnetic nanoparticles in association with magnetic fields are an important tool for the guidance and homing of these cells into damaged tissues, where they induce tissue repair.",

The previous project resulted in the implementation of behavioural paradigms for testing psychological functions and their disorders. Specifically, four tests of different aspects of impulsivity, a paradigm for testing emotion regulation strategies and their effectiveness, and a social cognition test distinguishing between affective and cognitive theories of mind were implemented. Behavioral tests can be used in conjunction with psychophysiological and neuroimaging methods to map the physiological and neural correlates of given mental functions that manifest during test performance, and finally to select targeted treatments, e.g., using rTMS. The parameters of the tests have been developed according to existing research results and adapted for use in the Czech population. The tests are original, therefore the first goal of the follow-up project is a detailed analysis of the performance of the healthy population, which is essential for understanding healthy test performance strategies and for the subsequent interpretation of results in patients with mental disorders. At the same time, the paradigms need to be tested first without neuroimaging methods that create a specific test situation. The second goal is to pilot the behavioral paradigms already with psychophysiological and neuroimaging methods in a healthy population. The third goal is to initiate full testing, i.e., behavioral paradigms in conjunction with psychophysiological and neuroimaging methods, in patients with mental disorders, specifically testing impulsivity in patients with borderline personality disorder, ADHD, and Parkinson's disease, testing emotion regulation in patients with eating disorders, and testing social cognition in patients with schizophrenia. Testing of healthy population and patients will take place at the Psychiatric Clinic of the University Hospital Brno and at CEITEC using the instrumentation of both departments.",

In experimental laboratory rat models, it has been shown that after intravenous administration of paclitaxel, pharmacologically induced peripheral neuropathy occurs, manifested by the triggering of an inflammatory response in the spinal ganglia, spinal cord and other structures of the central nervous system. Similar changes occur with chronic nerve injury, which also induces activation of satellite glial cells, invasion of activated macrophages, proliferation of microglia and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. The spread of the inflammatory response to the various stages of the central nervous system may be via the blood and/or the liquor. Our earlier experiments demonstrated the penetration of labeled dextran from blood and liquor into the spinal ganglion, demonstrating the permeability of the blood-nerve and liquor-nerve barriers to cytokine-sized molecules. We also found that peripheral nerve injury induces cellular changes and increased permeability of the blood-liquor barrier.  ",

In the area of HAE, we plan to continue our ongoing work on the importance of granulocyte activation in this disease. We will also monitor some clinical aspects of this disease, especially response to treatment (Dr R. Hakl, Dr E. Hlaváčková). In the molecular genetic part of the project we will analyse data from massive parallel whole exome sequencing in 2 families with clinical diagnosis of HAE, in which no causal mutation in SERPING1 or coagulation factor XII gene was detected, and we will continue to analyse the regions of SERPING1 gene that are important for regulation of mRNA splicing and C1 inhibitor expression (Mgr. T. Kováčová, Mgr. K. Novanská). In the part dealing with antibody immunodeficiencies we plan to continue the project of determining the stool microbiome in patients with agamaglobulinemia of the common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and selective IgA deficiency (IgAD) type using the next generation sequencing method. In patients with these diagnoses, a key mucosal IgA antibody is missing in the gastrointestinal tract mucosa, which may affect the composition of the gut microbiota and the development of infections and other enteropathies that CVID patients often suffer from.  (Mgr. K. Fiedorová, Mgr. Iva Kotásková). We will also look at the influence of sequence changes in the BTK gene (whose defect causes the primary defect in antibody production) on the regulation of mRNA splicing. We will also study some clinical and laboratory aspects of secondary immunodeficiency that develops in patients after corrective surgery of left ventricular hypoplasia and in paediatric patients after rituximab treatment (Dr. E. Hlaváčková). As a form of deliverables we expect mainly a presentation at conferences, but also a publication on secondary hypogammaglobulinemias in childhood (after reconstructive cardiac surgery or a review publication on secondary hypogammaglobulinemias in childhood) (Dr. Hlaváčková).",

HR prevents the rise of genomic instability associated with the development of tumorigenesis, but increased expression of recombination factors leads to resistance to anticancer therapy. Key proteins involved in HR include RAD51 recombinase, BRCA2 recombination mediator and RAD51 paralogs. Congenital mutations in these genes are associated with a predisposition to the development of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers and with the insidious inherited disease Fanconi anaemia (FA), characterized by short stature, changes in skin pigmentation, haematological abnormalities and increased risk of tumours. Despite all this, the exact molecular mechanism of action of the aforementioned proteins remains to be fully elucidated. In this project, we focus on the functional characterization of tumor mutations of the RAD51 protein. By studying fast reaction kinetics using the stopped-flow method, we have so far demonstrated the importance of the regulation of RAD51 presynaptic filament activity and conformation by the action of RAD51 paralogs. The next step is to isolate clinically relevant RAD51 mutants and determine their influence on the properties of the generated presynaptic filaments. The results obtained may contribute not only to the understanding of the molecular basis of FA and tumorigenesis, but also potentially to the development of new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of radio- and chemoresistant tumors.",

One of the biggest obstacles in production of pluripotent stem cells is adaptation of the cells to the culture conditions in vitro, accompanied by genome destabilization. Genome stability is also critical to the quality of germ cells. To protect the genomic stability, pluripotent cells as well as germ cells pose elevated BER and homologous recombination, while NHEJ remains constant. Such unique DNA repair setup can be found only in pluripotent stem cells and germ cells. While pluripotent stem cells dowregulate BER during prolonged cultivation similar decrease in BER was observed in male germ cells during ageing. The aim of the project is to verify the hypothesis that the pathway choice in BER rich pluripotent stem cells and germ cells affecting output error rate depends on the channeling of the base damage through BER mediated double stranded breaks to NHEJ, while the pluripotency controlling proteins cooperate on shielding the DNA ends from HR. Simultaneously we want to uncover pathways regulating the activity of BER related to ageing of germ cells and adaptation process in pluripotent stem cells.",

These co-morbidities are leading causes of further health decline and premature mortality, posing challenges for appropriate and effective healthcare and resources. Current treatments are unable to halt the disease epidemics and to prevent their late consequences. Identification and targeting new metabolic pathways and other metabolic abnormalities seem likely to yield improved therapy, particularly in a personalized approach. The aim of this project is to investigate how abnormal high levels of the reactive metabolite methylglyoxal (a principal marker of “dicarbonyl stress”) in obesity, diabetes and renal failure contributes to common mechanisms driving development of metabolic and vascular co-morbidities and exploit this for improved patient care. We will characterise the role of dicarbonyl stress in the co-morbidities and evaluate, at proof of concept stage, novel nutritional medicine treatments. The objectives are:\n1. To develop experimental evidence in preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the pathophysiological role of dicarbonyl stress in metabolic and vascular co-morbidities of obesity, diabetes and renal insufficiency.\n2. To personalize treatment and care by developing biomarkers to stratify the patient population by severity of dicarbonyl stress.\n3. To evaluate treatments for dicarbonyl stress to halt and alleviate co-morbidities. The primary clinical intervention evaluated is a dietary bioactive formulation (nutritional medicine) that increases expression of glyoxalase 1 - the enzyme that detoxifies methylglyoxal.\n4. To expand the skills base and share best practise in dicarbonyl stress research.\n5. To secure related technical and medical innovation for the EU. \nThe likely outcome will be novel diagnostic markers to facilitate personalized treatment of dicarbonyl stress and safe, nutritional medicine for alleviation of common co-morbidities.",

We will test the hypothesis that reduced integration abilities manifested on many levels of brain organization (from neurons to brain networks) are reflected in the impaired integration of mind - we will specifically test it by analysis of the ability to  integrate the information about the body in the mind, to integrate borders of bodily self, and to integrate novel information into context during psychotherapy. To achieve this we will use schizophrenia as a model that exhibits a reduction in  integration abilities. The major progress beyond the state of the art is the analysis of neural networks using computational tools, cellular pathophenotypic profiling using patient-specific glutamatergic neurons, advanced neuroimaging analyses of neuronal networks and connectivity with virtual reality simulations to provide ecological validity of behavioral paradigms, and novel approaches of the research of psychotherapy. We will employ medicine, psychological and social science approaches, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology (biology), mathematics and computational approaches.Through interdisciplinary collaborations, we will obtain pathophysiology in individual schizophrenic patients at multifaceted levels from cell, brain, to behaviour.

In diagnosis of CF, quantitative analysis of sweat chloride levels is widely accepted, but this procedure is flawed by lengthy and uncomfortable sampling procedure (application of the electric current on skin (iontophoresis)) causing discomfort, pain, itching, redness, skin burns and other symptoms, further by high incidence of false positive and/or false negative results from only chloride analysis and difficulty to set proper diagnostic chloride values, especially in newborn and children screening.The proposed project will be focused at solution of the difficulties which are described in the previous paragraph. The main task is development of novel, fast, non-invasive method for sampling of sweat samples, with particular target for optimization in newborn and pediatric screening. The preliminary results show that a new, proposed  sampling skin wipe method is simple, fast (<10s) and painless. The collected sample can be analyzed by capillary electrophoresis with contactless conductivity detection and double-opposite-end injection approach, allowing simultaneous determination of positively and negatively charged ions. This is of high importance, because it was found that the ionic content of both anions and cations is tightly connected with the ion transfer mechanisms and there were significant changes observed between the group of healthy and CF patients. The project output will have a high significance for the diagnosis of CF, especially to the newborn and pediatric patients, for which the conventional method is inconvenient. An added benefit will also be a higher discriminatory power by using multiparametric data analysis. We assume that the use of multiple ions and appropriate statistical methods will eliminate majority of the false positive and false negative results and will also more accurately pinpoint CF cases in peadiatric patients, especially in the border cases. The proposed project is based on collaboration of several specialists of different fields of science; this collaboration is essential for the successful implementation of the project and achievement of the project goal and the proposed approach may present a breakthrough in sweat testing.",

Schizophrenia is a condition with altered brain morphology, connectivity, and function. This disorder has no cure and is the most frequent cause of morbidity, disability, and impairment of individual quality of life and well-being. Substantial progress has been made in the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. However, modern antipsychotic medication is still associated with side effects, poor compliance, drug discontinuation, and low efficacy on negative and cognitive symptoms. The inaccessibility of brain cells to evaluate the cellular neuropathology and its changes in the context of clinical or treatment data of living patients is a major obstacle in understanding disease development and the progress of effective treatment. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology renders a breakthrough to convert skin cells, or other cell types, into brain cells (e.g., neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), whereby patient-specific brain cells can be structured in a 2D or a 3D system that mimics neural networks in the brain. This project is to employ iPSC technology with multifaceted approaches, which include biology (consisting of stem cell biology, neurobiology, genetics, and epigenetics), medicine, mathematics, and computational systems to establish a therapeutic platform for individual patients. The platform amalgams an in-vitro iPSC-based schizophrenic model system with in-vivo approaches (MRI imaging, EEG, and behavioural observations) to delineate the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the actions of antipsychotic drugs at multiple levels from molecule, cell, brain, to behaviour.

They include not only cellular based malfunction, most often ion mishandling or organelle defects, such as channelopathies or mitochondrial diseases, but also whole organ impairment such as sinus node diseases. Many of these defects can be corrected to certain degree by symptomatic treatment. However the molecular basis of arrhythmias remains to be treated by future cell replacement therapies. Conventional anti-bradyarrhythmic strategies such as implantation of electronic pacemakers must deal with potential infections, limited battery life and invasive implantation of leads. Although there have been technical improvements, these strategies still lack neurohumoral reactivity. The aim of the present research project is to exploit recent advances in stem cell research and genetic engineering, to develop patient specific cell based strategies in order to fabricate a “biopacemaker” that overcomes the drawbacks of an artificial machine. Channelopathies leading to either arrhythmias or other heart defects will be modelled in vitro using patient specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to uncover the molecular basis of the disease phenotype and to screen for novel drugs. Human fibroblasts and iPSC overexpressing specific channels (e.g. RyR, HCN, KCN, SERCA families etc) either wild type or harbouring patient specific mutations will serve as both the tool to investigate the diseased phenotype and as a “biopacemaker” (BPM) both in vitro and in vivo. Novel system based on the xenograft models in immunodeficient animals will be designed for the assessment of safety to the use of human pluripotent stem cell based tools. Safety of introduced cellular components will be optimized by elimination of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells and alternatively using other patient specific adult cells. Optimal cardiac cell sub-type and stage of cardiac cell development will be evaluated by evaluating expression of cardiac proteins, mitochondrial and cellular metabolisms and performing functional studies such as intracellular calcium measurements, electrophysiology and mechano-biological measurements. Finally the resulting cardiomyocytes will serve as Biopacemaker (BP) in vitro and in vivo.",

To achieve our aims, EuroStemCell will\nadopt the highly structured system for coordinated information management established by the FP7 Coordination and Support Action (CSA) also called EuroStemCell. From this, we will implement an ambitious programme of online and direct stakeholder engagement with stem cell research and regenerative medicine, aimed at European citizens at all educational levels. This will include provision of resources tailored specifically for decision-making on stem cell-related questions and an extensive programme of dissemination and capacity building in science communications and public engagement. The proposed work centres on an information hub team, which will link to all project partners and to stakeholders in the stem cell and regenerative medicine arenas and wider society, working with these groupings to implement the project. All outputs will be delivered in 6 European languages, to ensure broad accessibility, and will be rigorously evaluated against measurable objectives throughout the project duration. The proposed consortium comprises leading stem cell labs across Europe,including new member states, together with experts in ethical and societal concerns and evaluating clinical outcomes. It thus provides unparalleled European expertise across the fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine and is uniquely placed to maintain and further develop www.eurostemcell.org as a world-leading stem cell information resource, thus meeting the challenge outlined in Topic HOA-6-2014.",

However, roughly 25% of these patients will progress to multiple myeloma (MM) at which time the disease may already have severe clinical consequences. Although several primarily effective therapeutic options are available the disease remains incurable and fatal. Furthermore, clinicians lack personalised diagnostic tools that can serve as a rational basis for a selection of those therapeutics which are most likely to work in a given patient at a given time. \nThe concept behind this proposal is that MM growth and survival depend on cell autonomous mechanisms (= oncogenic driver mutations) and non-cell autonomous mechanisms (signals from the tumour microenvironment). These tumour promoting mechanisms (TPMs) are essential for the tumour cell fate and thus it is imperative to first identify and then to target all of them in order to break the resilience of MM cells to therapy and pave the way for disease eradication.\nConsequently, the INDICANT consortium (lat. indicare = show the way) aims to establish an integrative diagnostic platform for the identification and validation of all patient specific and druggable TPMs, thereby enabling clinicians to select targeted therapeutic choices for MM patients specifically tailored to their individual TPM-profile. A concise health technology assessment will be part of the developmental program of this innovative diagnostic platform.\nSince the envisaged diagnostic platform is applicable to other areas of oncology as well, the project results will open new markets for SMEs and industrial partners in the diagnostics sector and further push the development of products and services for personalised medicine.",

Thus, finding ways to enhancing motor skill learning capacity in Parkinson’s is essential. Past research indicates that sensory stimulation and task cueing can improve motor learning. Yet, the extent to which increasing individual’s engagement in the task, in addition to sensory stimulation, can have further positive effects remains unknown. This innovation grant aims to demonstrate that increased task engagement through ecological goals and social interaction can significantly improve procedural learning capacity in people with Parkinson’s. To this end, performance in a classical implicit motor learning paradigm (goal: reacting to stimuli presented on a computer screen) will be contrasted with that of two other conditions, where a console videogame (similar to Guitar Hero) will be used, with or without social interaction, in a controlled experiment involving people with Parkinson’s and age and gender-matched controls. The ecological goals in the videogame conditions (playing a musical instrument alone or during social interaction) are expected to increase task engagement and improve motor learning capacity more than the classical paradigm. The project is innovative because it uses existing low-cost technology to evaluate the ecological contribution of motivation/reward in increasing motor skill learning capacity in Parkinson’s. This research is a critical step in further expanding the range of low-cost, non-pharmacological interventions which can easily be implemented outside the clinical setting (i.e. at home) and tailored to one’s needs/preferences, hence contributing to the advancement of personalized tele-interventions means in Parkinson’s.",

To protect the genomic stability, pluripotent cells pose elevated base excision repair (BER) and homologous recombination (HR), while non homologous end joining (NHEJ) remains constant. We hypothesize, that the pathway choice affecting output error rate depends on the channeling of the base damage through BER mediated double stranded breaks to NHEJ, while unrepaired base damage triggering replicative stress-induced HR leaves the cells with more mutations.

Aberrant FGFR activation frequently leads to disease. Activating mutations in FGFR3 alone account for at least 10 conditions, including syndromes affecting skeletal development, skin and cancer. Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase represents a major mediator of the FGFR function, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown. \nOur preliminary experiments point to a complex regulatory networks that operate at many different subcellular levels to allow for prolonged ERK activation in FGFR signaling. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, interactions of FGFRs with the protein members of their signaling complexes, processes governing active FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR-ERK signal. Through a combination of mathematical modelling, genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry approaches, we will describe, for the first time, the regulatory networks mediating prolonged activation of ERK pathway, in major biological processes regulated by FGFRs. These will include pathological FGFR signaling in skeletal dysplasias and cancer, and physiological FGFR signaling in maintenance of pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC).\n Unraveling of the mechanisms regulating FGFR-ERK signaling, proposed in this project, not only holds a key to our understanding of the basic mechanics of FGFR signal transduction, but will also aid an identification of novel therapeutic targets for pathological conditions caused by aberrant FGFR signaling.",

We will delineate the effects of SHANK3 dysregulation on human glutamatergic neurons derived from hESCs and decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms using the combination of state-of-the-art gene targeting techniques, electrophysiology and cell imaging. The hESC-based human autism model may provide a useful tool for drug development and translational research.",

   "annotation": "Maintenance of genomic integrity ensured by multifaceted cellular DNA damage response (DDR) is a fundamental feature of life. The DDR network of checkpoint and repair pathways counterbalances the potentially mutagenic effects of endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging assaults, thereby avoiding and/or delaying the onset of life-threatening diseases, neurodegenerative and immunological disorders, premature aging or cancer. Despite the recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of the DDR, many mechanistic aspects, including genes and pathways of DNA damage recognition, replication fork maintenance and re-start, damage signalling, checkpoint control, DNA repair, or chromatin modulation remain to be discovered and/or characterized. In this proposal, six laboratories with complementary multidisciplinary expertise join forces to improve our current knowledge in this area of biomedicine. In particular, we hypothesize that an omnipotent threat to genomic integrity in all proliferating cells may represent the major source of genomic instability that leads to cancer or other diseases. We aim to: 1) characterise the role of selected nucleases/glycosylases in DDR pathways with main focus on their regulation and redundancy. In particular, we will focus on protein-mediated interactions and post-translational modification by SUMOylation; 2) optimize hits identified in the pilot experiments with the aim to identify novel organic compounds with targeted biological activity that would be superior to known inhibitors; 3) identify genetic backgrounds that confer sensitivity (SSL phenotype) to a simultaneous inhibition of activity of selected key genome stability-associated genes, which may be potentially exploitable in the clinic. \nThis Project will also provide insights into coordination of DNA replication, recombination and repair, and generate and validate small molecule modulators of key DDR enzymes as biological tools to better understand the DDR machinery and its disease-predisposing aberrations. The chemical biology approach also addresses fundamental concerns of possibly misleading phenotypes upon elimination of a protein (e.g. by RNAi-mediated knock-down), rather than inhibiting its function while preserving the protein’s abundance, interactions and compartmentalization.",

We now dissect the signaling pathways that STAMP2 is involved in to promote PCa proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis, in particular related to the metabolic pathways involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). Whereas Saatcioglu laboratory has world leading expertise to study STAMP2 expression and function, Masarik laboratory is steeped in metabolic pathways and ROS in PCa. The combination of the two areas of expertise is expected to result in significant new knowledge. In addition, nanoparticle mediated STAMP2 targeting in preclinical mouse models of PCa have proved to be curative and will be further developed and optimized, thus potentially leading to proof-of-principle findings that may form the basis for translational applications.",

They are very diverse molecules in terms of size, microbial targets, mode of action, release from producer cells, and immunity mechanisms of the producing strains. With an increasing need for alternatives for existing antibiotic therapies in the last decades, bacteriocins are one of the most hopeful alternatives to “classical” antibiotics. The main feature distinguishing colicins (i.e. bacteriocins produced by enterobacteria) from classical antibiotics is that colicins have a relatively narrow killing spectrum. This colicin specificity is caused by highly specific molecular interactions of a colicin molecule with components of a cell envelope of susceptible bacteria (receptor molecules). Since the molecular interactions responsible for colicin specificity are still not fully understood, this project focuses on the identification of epitopes that underlie the receptor specificity of selected colicin types with medical potential. For detailed characterization of these epitopes, an interdisciplinary approach comprising structural biology and molecular biology methods will be used. Based on the detailed understanding of specific colicin-bacterium interactions, we plan to construct novel colicin variants with directed antimicrobial specificity. Synthetic variants of colicins with modified activity spectra could be a starting point for new alternative or supplementary antibiotic therapies.",

Similarly, many individuals are genetically predisposed to ritualized behavior and appear to engage in these behaviors in order to reduce stress. Yet the way in which ritualized behaviors may allay stress across individuals, and in different social contexts, remains unknown. Previous research in this area has suffered from 3 major shortcomings:  1) a reliance on self-report data that fails to recognize the complexity of rituals, 2) it ignores individual variance in physiological stress profiles, and 3) has suffered from a lack of interdicipinary collaboration. The proposed research directly addresses these shortcomings by developing a highly interdisciplinary team to run field experiments on naturally occurring rituals in Fiji, Slovakia, and Serbia, and controlled laboratory experiments to investigate how ritual behavior impacts a person's homonal stress levels. In both the laboratory and the field we will use cutting-edge technology to assess the effects of different types and aspects of ritual behavior on stress responses by measuring physiological responses (heart rate, galvanic skin response), salivary steroid hormones (cortisol/testosterone/estradiol) and brain natriuretic peptide levels. The proposed research therefore represents an innovative study of a significant aspect of human behavior at the hormonal, behavioral, and socio-cultural levels. The research has the potential to inform a longstanding topic interest in many disciplines, and will do so in such a way as to elucidate the connections between diverse behavioral forms and physiological stress levels.",

   "annotation": "Religious and/or secular rituals are present in all known societies (historical or present), yet their possible functions are still debated. This natural human activity carries formidable epistemic, metabolic and material costs without any apparent benefits and therefore yields an evolutionary puzzle which is exemplified especially in extreme rituals often involving enormous physiological costs, body mutilation, pain or sacrifice of precious resources. We encounter those in religious ceremonial practices as well as in military rituals or other types of initiative hazing. Given such costs, some evolutionary theorists argue that rituals must provide, or in the ancestral past must have provided, countervailing adaptive benefits. A long-standing tradition of social scientists stressed the role of collective rituals in the building of social cohesion and in-group trust (connected, on the other hand, with increase of out-group hostility). However, these assumptions have been rarely empirically tested and we still lack physiological mechanisms mediating these effects. Moreover, any real progress in this topic has been so far obstructed by fragmentary approach of separate disciplines. We therefore propose a series of studies conducted on multiple levels of analysis (from hormonal level to intra-/inter-group dynamics level) to elucidate (i) possible effects of extreme rituals on social cohesion, and (ii) purported working mechanisms behind these effects. By creating a highly integrative interdisciplinary team of top-rated scholars using diverse methodologies (ethnographic, experimental, mathematical modelling, social network analysis), we plan to bring novel understanding of the societal functions of extreme rituals and significantly contribute to understanding of this type of human behaviour.",

From socio-economic point of view, two general population surveys and an outpatient survey will be integral part of the study with aim to measure the incidence and prevalence of selected infectious diseases and their risk factors. Data obtained will serve in eco-epidemiologic studies (risk assessment, new trends in emerging infections, future outbreak scenarios or molecular epidemiology). Experts from different fields of science: ecology, microbiology, veterinary and human medicine and sociology will contribute to surveillance, control and prevention of emerging infectious diseases in the Czech Republic.

The STN is thought to be prominently involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). As such it has become a main therapeutic target for PD treatment. Inactivation of the STN by deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves motor deficits. On the other hand mild to moderate impairment of cognitive functions after STN-DBS is reported in some patients. Thus, besides its key role in motor functions STN is by most authors also accepted to have impact on non-motor functions. The STN seems to have an anatomically central position within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical associative and limbic loops. Moreover, hypothesis of cortico-STN bypass of the BG-thalamocortical circuitry under some circumstances was introduced recently suggesting that such “hyperdirect” connections might underlie the processing of some of the non-motor functions. As the exact role of the STN in non-motor functions as well as mechanisms of cognitive after-effects of STN-DBS are yet unknown, we propose to characterize the cortico-subcortical functional connectivity in PD patients using high density EEG and simultaneous intracranial EEG in STN. In this project we will investigate: 1) whether neuro-electric activity of STN recorded with intracerebral electrodes during cognitive task differs among specific functional microstates defined with simultaneous high density scalp EEG recording, and 2) how parameters of DBS influence the temporal organization of the topographic configuration of the scalp potential fields. We believe that combination of high density EEG with deep brain recording and stimulation may allow conclusions about the role of STN in the cognitive functional networks involved in the generation of the EEG microstates. These new findings will have clinical importance in understanding cognitive after-effects of STN-DBS and in optimization of parameters of DBS.",

Moreover, recent evidence from in vivo models (fly, mice) strongly suggests a context-dependent role for a centrosome in proliferation and differentiation. Hence, this raises an intriguing possibility of cell type-specific requirements for a correct number of centrosomes during their proliferation and terminal differentiation. However, our current understanding of the role of centrosome in such processes is surprisingly sparse.\nEmbryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the ability of unlimited proliferation, and can differentiate into any cell type of interest. Moreover, recent technological development has enabled to efficiently utilize methods of stable transgene expression or RNA interference also in human ESCs. These features make them very suitable candidates to study the function of centrosome in proliferation and differentiation, in the context of non-transformed human cells.\nIn this proposal I will use hESCs to study the function of centrosome and impact of its numerical anomalies on proliferation and cell differentiation.

Nowadays, only the heart rate branch of BR is studied but little is known about the heart contractility or vessel resistance branches. The technical aim is to study one- (bioimpedance, photoplethysmography) or multi-dimensional (ultrasound) signals, and develop new methodologies for the estimation of particular BR branches gains and calculate complex index of BR sensitivity. A genetic team: structural genes and genes of hormones/receptors that influences BR; biochemical team: plasma levels of different parameters (minerals, leptin, etc.) and how they influence gains of BR. The physiological and clinical teams: changes of BR branches in several models (hypertension, heart failure, etc.). The results of all teams will bring new understandings about the blood pressure regulation that can lead to improved detection the better distinguishing of patients subgroups with the same symptoms but different pathophysiological mechanisms, and therefore more appropriate therapy choice.",

The particles will be monitored by modern in vivo imaging methods including confocal microscopy and optical tomography. The optimized in vivo imaging protocols will be subsequently applied to experimental animals bearing tumours. The particles will serve on side as labels of tumour development and as tools for targeted drugs delivery that may overcome resistance and decrease drug side effects. Both applications will be investigated to find types of materials and modifications suitable for in vivo imaging and drug delivery systems.",

Impairments of these immune cells (T and B cells) have poor prognostic value in MM. Very recently, we and others have shown that increased Treg cells are associated with inferior time to disease progression and overall survival in MM. One important thing that is not fully studied is “interaction of immune cells with myeloma tumor microenvironment (composed of an important factor- BMSCs) that leads to myelomagenesis”. Therefore, understanding the interaction of BMSCs and immune cells, and the changes induced by BMSC in immune cells would help to reveal other side of myeloma pathogenesis and new targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Thus, centers included in the program provide medical care to virtually all patients in their country. In addition, each of the topics dealt by Euretino is the subject of expertise of one, and occasionally more than one major national referral center. Namely, examples of vast expertise in these topics include: the VUMC Hospital in Amsterdam in long-term sequelae especially second malignancies, the Institute Curie in chemotherapy treatment of intraocular and extraocular disease, CHUV Hospital in conservative treatment, Universitätsklinikum Essen in the molecular diagnosis of RB1 gene mutation. This provides an opportunity of leading, generalizing and multiplying their expertise with the other participants in the context of the network. These centers provide national coverage to virtually all retinoblastoma patients and they are referral centers for training and consultation at a global level. Included also in Euretino are all centers that are currently taking care of retinoblastoma patients in Spain, Italy, UK, France, Netherlands, Belgiium, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In these cases, treatment is de-centralized but, all centers treating retinoblastoma patients are included, so they represent accurately the situation at a national level. Some of them are historical leaders in different fields of retinoblastoma care. It is expected that as a result of this network a more harmonized standard of care would be achieved. Patient associations are represented by Retinostop, a French association with regional coverage and vast contact with smaller parental groups in the region.

However, changes in cell phenotype that do not show alterations in cell morphology, karyotype composition, genome re-arrangements or simply are not covered by particular molecular markers may stay unrecognized. Advanced bioanalytical methods, such matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization – time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) provide a powerful tool for discrimination and characterization of various chemical compounds, dependent on their mass to charge ratio (m/z). MALDI-TOF mass spectra generated from ionized molecules desorbed from the whole cells and tissues are very complex and depend strongly on the experimental conditions, matrix choice, machine setup or even the operator skill. However, they may serve as input data for sophisticated mathematical analysis, e.g. artificial intelligence or artificial neural networks (AI/ANN) resulting in complementary image of cell or tissue compositions. Direct whole cell- or tissue-MALDI-TOF MS followed by AI/ANN bypass the need for particular markers and/or direct observation that is sometimes limited. By using anonymous mass spectra aligned with already known characteristics may provide fast, robust and independent method for recognition of the whole cells and tissues and to be suitable even for automated diagnostics. This projects aims for adaptation of current MALDI-TOF technology for cytological and histological evaluations and together with AI/ANN develop a framework for diagnosing of tissue samples, archive slides or clinical-grade cell cultures.",

Acute administration of selected drugs before the IVSA session will determine the extent of hypothesized drug intake reduction when co-administered (analogous to an outpatient treatment without demonstrable abstinence).\n2. Influence on relapse prevention will be determined by chronic administration of the drugs during methamphetamine withdrawal and consequent recurrent access to the psychostimulant (analogous to an inpatient treatment where abstinence is maintained and subsequent outpatient follow-up).",

Reparative processes proceed only in peripheral nervous system naturally. It is related with the secretion of adhesive proteins by Schwann cells. Axons are newly guided by these proteins. Recently, it is possible to develop suitable microenvironment with biomaterials to support axonal growth. Material surfaces can be modified with adhesive ligands. The goal of this project is to support the growth of neuronal axons by the surface modification with synthetic peptides mimicking adhesive biomolecules of extracellular matrix and cell membrane. Neurons are derived from human embryonic stem cells. Main priority is the characterization of axonal guidance by 2D and 3D microenvironment with concentration gradient of immobilized peptides in combination with dissolved myelin inhibitory proteins (Nogo, MAG, OMgp). These results will lead to specification of materials and their modifications available for CNS repair after injury.",

   "annotation": "Reliable prediction of prognosis and therapeutic response based on molecular factors will¨undoubtedly lead to more personalized cancer medicine. Despite increasing biological knowledge though, only few biological markers for ovarian or prostate cancer have entered clinical practice so far. TUSC3 (N33) is a gene localized in a region frequently deleted in cancer (8p22). Recently, we found that expression of TUSC3 is significantly decreased due to the promoter methylation in malignant ovarian samples compared to benign controls having a strong influence on progression free and overall survival independently of other prognostic factors. The in vitro reconstitution of TUSC3 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines showed localization to the endoplasmic reticulum as a subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase complex. Silencing of TUSC3 also induced changes in\nphenotype of ovarian cancer cells resulting in enhanced proliferation and migration. Deeper identification of its role in malignant transformation can bring TUSC3 to a forefront as a putative\ntherapeutic target in cancer.",

Experimental data confirm that mesenchymal stromal cells carrying therapeutic genes are able to home and engraft into the site of tumour burden, and they can be used as vehicles for delivery of therapeutic molecules directly into the tumour. We will focus on malignancies incurable with current therapeutic modalities, especially on glioblastoma and metastatic melanoma.  We will simultaneously compare the therapeutic efficiency of two prodrug-converting systems mediated by AT-MSC: cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine and Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir. Comparison will be performed both in vitro and in vivo on established cell lines and malignant cells isolated from patient suffering from glioblastoma or malignant melanoma. We would like to contribute to understanding of mechanisms responsible for therapy efficiency and confirm the safety of cancer gene therapy mediated by retroviraly transduced MSC expressing prodrug-converting genes. Originality of our project is in the combination of cell and gene therapy using adipose tissue as a source of therapeutic MSC in the glioblastoma treatment pioneering the novel treatment strategy in this rapidly progressive disease where no definitive cure exists so far. The aim of the project is to bring this innovative therapeutic approach closer to the patient. All experiments will be performed with regard to clinical outcome. Besides therapy efficiency, approval of safety is involved in the project.",

A crucial factor within all nurse education systems should be the educational relationship between the staff nurse mentor and student. However, such approaches are not universal because the Mentorship model can be moderately unknown; there are already countries where qualified nurses operate quite independently supervising students and also countries where qualified nurses don't join this process at all. This is more caused by cultural tradition than opinions of single individuals.

Například u některých IPP stále neznáme přesnou patofyziologii vzniku tohoto onemocnění, ani účinnou kauzální léčbu. Co se týče nádorů plicní tkáně, zde sice máme k dispozici různé terapeutické možnosti, nicméně i přesto je prognóza pacientů závažná. Proto je velice důležité plicní tkáň studovat a zejména se pokusit vytvořit v laboratoři trojrozměrné modely zdravé i patologické plicní tkáně ve zdraví i nemoci, které by umožnily lépe pochopit průběh těchto plicních onemocnění, případně moci i na těchto modelech otestovat nově vyvíjená léčiva a umožnit tak do budoucna personalizaci léčby přesně na míru pacienta. V tomto projektu budeme modelovat plicní tkáň podléhající intersticiálním plicním procesům (idiopatická plicní fibróza, sarkoidóza) a nádorové transformaci. Pro pochopení patogeneze a personalizaci modelu je extrémně důležité získat lidské buňky, které jediné jsou relevantní pro poznávání patogeneze onemocnění a hledání nových terapeutických možností. Takovéto buňky je možné použít přímo v podobě izolace primárních buněk, či z nich získat indukované pluripotentní kmenové buňky a tyto diferencovat do terminálně diferencovaných buněčných typů plicní tkáně. Následně se dají buňky zkombinovat s buněčným nosičem – decelularizovanou extracelulární hmotou plic, která rekapituluje základní architekturu a bioaktivitu plicní tkáně. Toto nám umožní vytvořit 3D model plicní tkáně v laboratorních podmínkách a využít jej pro výzkumné účely. Studiem vzorků lidské plicní tkáně a laboratorně vytvořených plicních modelů bude umožněno detailnější pochopení vzájemných vztahů a funkčních souvislostí mezi buňkami za podmínek zdraví a nemoci, konkrétně patogeneze IPP a nádorů plic.

   "annotation": "Hematoonkologická onemocnění se řadí mezi relativně časté malignity. Mají většinou rychlý a agresivní průběh a ovlivňují tak život nejen pacienta, ale i jeho okolí. Nejdůležitějším cílem péče o tyto jedince je tedy pokud možno úplné vyléčení nemoci (je-li to možné), nebo alespoň dosažení dlouhodobé remise, aby se pacient mohl vrátit zpět do běžného života. \n\nNutné je proto nejen včasné rozpoznání onemocnění, ale také jeho přesná diagnostika a podání kvalitní terapie. Velkým příslibem je zavádění tzv. personalizované medicíny, která umožňuje pacientovi upravit léčbu podle jeho potřeb včetně snížení nežádoucích účinků na minimum, přičemž komplexně posuzuje různé faktory ovlivňující působení dané terapie. \n\nSoučástí léčby bývají velmi často infekční komplikace – řadí se dokonce k častější příčině úmrtí než choroba samotná. Aby tedy nedošlo k bezprostřednímu ohrožení života nemocného, je nevyhnutelné včas a správně rozpoznat původce infekce a začít s vhodnou a účinnou léčbou. \n\nCílem grantového projektu je přispět k detailnějšímu poznání biologie a patogeneze hematologických malignit a výsledky klinického i laboratorního výzkumu pomoci ke zkvalitnění života onkologických pacientů.",

Zobrazovací metody prošly v posledním desetiletí významnou evolucí, objevily se metody jako PET/MR či dual-energy CT, které umožňují snížit radiační zátěž, zlepšit detekci a charakterizaci nádorových i nenádorových lézí. Zdokonalením prošly nejen diagnostické zobrazovací metody, ale paralelně s nimi i techniky miniinvazivní endovaskulární či perkutánní léčby.\n\nVzhledem k obrovskému nárůstu dat získaných zobrazovacími metodami na různých pracovištích byla nutná standardizace vyšetřovacích protokolů, která zajistila možnost srovnání těchto vyšetření na stejném i mezi různými pracovišti. Při pokračujícím růstu nároků na zobrazovací metody je žádoucí tyto protokoly optimalizovat, aktualizovat a zahrnout do nich i nejnovější zobrazovací metody (dual-energy CT, spektrální CT, PET/MR, pokročilé zobrazovací metody MR), maximalizovat výtěžnost těchto vyšetření při minimální radiační zátěži, minimálním čase a minimální dávce intravenózní kontrastní látky. Podobná je situace také na poli radiologických intervenčních metod, kde je cílem maximální efekt s minimem nežádoucích účinků, což umožňuje zachovat spolupráci pacienta a jeho vůli se léčit.\n\nCílem projektu je vyhodnocení účinnosti stávajících protokolů specifických zobrazovacích a intervenčních metod při diagnostice a léčbě onkologických onemocnění a akutních stavů (plicní embolie, cévní mozková příhoda, končetinová ischémie), dále radiologických intervenčních metod při léčbě onkologických i neonkologických onemocnění (léčba benigních a maligních stenóz žlučových cest, benigních a maligních stenóz jícnu, stenóz periferních tepen, léčba cévních mozkových příhod). Výsledky při využití specifických zobrazovacích a intervenčních metod budou srovnány s výsledky bez využití těchto pokročilých zobrazovacích metod.",

Důkazy získané celou řadou metod naznačují, že právě obtíže s lokalizací zvuku v prostoru tvoří klíčovou příčinu symptomů PAS. V této studii navazujeme na již probíhající projekt ve spolupráci s MAFIL CEITEC a budeme u jedinců s PAS ve věku 15 až 20 let pokračovat v analýze, jak se prostorové zvukové stimuly zpracovávají v primárním sluchovém kortexu nově za použití multimodálního přístupu – EEG a funkční magnetická rezonance. Chceme objasnit, jaký vliv mají tóny o různé frekvenci s různými prostorovými vlastnostmi na zpracování v sluchovém kortexu a jak jsou jedinci s PAS schopni odfiltrovat zvuk v pozadí ke správnému zaměření pozornosti na zvukový stimul v prostoru.      ",

Cirkadiánní rytmy jsou řízené molekulárním mechanismem transkripčně translačních interakcích tzv. hodinových genů. Schopnost rytmických oscilací si buňky zachovávají i v buněčných kulturách a umožnují nám tak sledovat řadu řídících i výstupních procesů v in vitro prostředí. Cirkadiánní rytmy byly doposud popsány a studovány především na 2D buněčných modelech. Komplexnější přístup, něž 2D buněčné kultury dnes nabízí 3D buněčné modely diferenciované z lidských indukovaných pluripotentních buněk (iPSCs), které dokáží lépe vystihnout některé lidské fyziologické i patofyziologické mechanismy. Mezi tyto 3D modely patří i retinální organoidy. Naše současná data prokazují, že retinální organoidy jsou fotosenzitivní, jsou v nich zastoupeny všechny retinální buněčné typy a exprimují hodinové geny. Retinální organoidy tak mají veškeré předpoklady k vytvoření komplexních cirkadiánních hodin. Cílem tohoto projektu je prokázat v retinálních organoidech přítomnost cirkadiánních oscilací, jejich schopnost synchronizace se světlem a lokalizovat cirkadiánní oscilátor v retině. Validizace cirkadiánních oscilací v retinálních organoidech na molekulární a humorální úrovni poskytne plnohodnotný humánní retinální model, který umožní nejen studium cirkadiánních disfunkcí u retinálních patologii jako je například diabetická retinopatie, ale nabídne i lidský model ke studiu cirkadiánního systému retiny.",

   "annotation": "Popis projektu:\nI přes aktuálně dostupná pilotní data z dospělé populace, není měření hloubky anestezie u dětských pacientů standardem. Hloubka anestezie může být rizikovou součástí anestezie, jelikož může být spojena se zvýšeným výskytem perioperačních a pooperačních komplikací. Pediatrická populace je stran výskytu perioperační bdělosti obzvláště riziková vzhledem na minimum dostupných dat a taktéž na omezenou možnost pooperačního screeningu perioperační bdělosti zejména u menších dětí.\n\nÚvod a zdůvodnění:\nPerioperační měření hloubky anestezie (a event. analgezie) je aktuálně doporučená součást běžné anesteziologické praxe. Optimální hloubka anestezie v případě měření pomocí bispektrálního indexu (BIS) je mezi hodnotami 40-60. Mělčí (BIS nad 60) anestezie může být asociována se zvýšeným výskytem epizod perioperační bdělosti, a hlubší (BIS pod 40) anestezie může vést k častějšímu výskytu nežádoucích účinků anestezie, včetně hemodynamické nestability.\n\nHypotéza této studie je, že v průběhu anestezie bez perioperačního měření hloubky anestezie může docházet k fluktuacím hloubky anestezie mimo doporučená rozmezí. Počet fluktuací a kumulativní čas mimo rozmezí (40-60 BIS) může být asociován s výskytem pooperačních komplikací jako pooperační delirium (definováno hodnotou PAED skóre (Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium Score) nad 10, nebo nad 12– 2 metodiky měření), výskytem pooperační nauzey a zvracení (PONV) a výskytem jiných pooperačním komplikací (respirační, hemodynamické).\nPrimární outcome:\nKumulativní čas strávený mimo doporučené rozmezí pro hloubku anestezie\nSekundární outcome:\n-\tincidence fluktuací BIS mimo doporučené rozmezí (definované jako >30 vteřin mimo rozmezí doporučené hloubky anestezie, ukončeno návratem do definovaného rozmezí)\n-\tschopnost anesteziologa reagovat na dané fluktuace definovaná jako reakce ANO/NE + typ intervence (podání i.v. anestetika, opioidu, sedativ, relaxace, prohloubení inhalační anestezie, jiná)\n-\tlatence reakce anesteziologa na danou fluktuaci – definovaná ve vteřinách od vzniku fluktuace po ukončení fluktuace = návrat do doporučeného pásma hloubky anestezie\n-\tincidence pooperačního deliria měřené pomocí PAED skóre\n-\tPONV incidence\n-\tkumulativní výskyt komplikací",

Resuscitaci u dětí začínáme podle doporučení Evropské Resuscitační Rady (ERC) a ILCOR (International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation) 5 iniciálními vdechy, neboť u dětí dochází často k srdeční zástavě z hypoxické příčiny. Vlastní doporučení ERC jsou v otázce 5 iniciálních vdechů založena na názoru expertů (expert opinion). Nejsou totiž k dispozici data, která by zkoumala efektivitu ventilace u simulovaných či reálných situací srdeční zástavy u dětí. Cílem této studie je zkoumat efektivitu iniciálních vdechů, definovanou jako viditelné zvednutí hrudníku na simulačních figurínách u zdravotnických profesionálů (lékaři a sestry) a u laiků. \nHypotéza: U zdravotnických profesionálů bude efektivních více než 80% pokusů o iniciální vdechy pomocí samorozpínacího vaku (4 z 5 pokusů o vdech). U laiků, kteří budou ventilaci provádět dýcháním z úst do úst, bude efektivních více jak 60% pokusů o iniciální vdechy (3 z 5 pokusů o vdech).\nCíle: Primárním sledovaným parametrem této studie je zhodnotit počet efektivních dechů, definovaných jako viditelné zvednutí hrudníku, během pokusů o 5 iniciálních vdechů  u simulované kardiopulmonální resuscitace na pediatrických figurínách. Sekundární sledované parametry budou zahrnovat subanalýzu efektivity prvních dvou pokusů o vdech, čas do prvního efektivního vdechu, dechový objem podaný během 5 iniciálních vdechů a ventilace během KPR.",

   "annotation": "Schizofrenie (SCZ) je závažné psychotické onemocnění, které postihuje až 1,5 % populace. Antipsychotika druhé generace jsou doporučována jako léky první volby vzhledem k jejich vyšší účinnosti a nízkému výskytu nežádoucích účinků. Bohužel až 30 % pacientů nereaguje na farmakoterapii. Klozapin (CLO) je antipsychotikum ze skupiny MARTA, je antagonistou dopaminových receptorů typu 2 (D2) a serotoninu typu 2A (5-HT2A). Je indikován zejména u pacientů rezistentních k farmakoterapii antipsychotiky první nebo druhé volby a některými autory je považován za nejúčinnější antipsychotikum vůbec. Koncentrace CLO je spojena nejen s klinickou odpovědí, ale i s vedlejšími účinky závislými na dávce, kde jsou nejzávažnější generalizované tonicko-klonické záchvaty. Terapeutické monitorování léčiv (TDM) tedy může vést k individuálnímu dávkování k dosažení cílové expozice a prevenci vedlejších účinků závislých na dávce. TDM se tradičně provádí z plazmy získané po odběru venózní krve, což může být pro některé pacienty stresující. Mikroodběrové metody a techniky jsou méně invazivní; nejrozšířenější mezi nimi je odběr suché krevní skvrny (DBS). Druhou vhodnou matricí pro monitorování AED jsou sliny nebo suchá kapka slin. Mini-invazivní odběr vzorků by mohl vést ke zvýšené dostupnosti TDM a důkladnější kontrole požadovaných hladin CLO, lepšímu dodržování léčby, snížené frekvenci nežádoucích účinků, stejně jako samoodběru doma a snížení stresu pacientů. Nové matrice vzorků vyžadují důkladnou klinickou validaci. Primárním cílem projektu je vyvinout nové analytické metody pro TDM CLO. s využitím alternativních matric (DBS, sliny) a ověřit jejich použití v klinické praxi v rámci nemocniční péče.\n\nNaším cílem je provést důkladnou klinickou validaci metod a porovnat koncentrace CLO nacházejících se v plazmě s hodnotami v DBS a/nebo slinách odebraných současně. Získané výsledky následně statisticky vyhodnotit. Dále bude nastavena interní kontrola kvality pro TDM CLO v nových matricích. Výsledky tohoto projektu by mohly podpořit legislativní doporučení pro vývoj a validaci metod využívajících alternativní matrice.",

   "annotation": "Biogeneze většiny transmembránových a sekretovaných proteinů závisí na systémech endoplazmatického retikula (ER) a Golgi. Deregulace ER procesů, způsobená dědičnou mutací, onkogenní transformací či narušenou homeostázou organismu může vést k nesprávnému skládání a lokalizaci proteinů, a způsobovat tak ER stres. Prvotní odpovědí buňky na ER stres je tzv. unfolded protein response (UPR), jejíž cílem je obnovení proteinové rovnováhy; pokud tato odpověď selže, nastupuje buněčná smrt. Mohutný ER stres doprovází celou řadu patologií včetně hematologických malignit, a jeho míra obvykle negativně koreluje s prognózou pacienta. To naznačuje že ER stres není nádory pouze tolerován, ale je jimi pravděpodobně upřednostňován; mechanismy tohoto jevu však nejsou příliš známy.\nChronická lymfocytární leukémie (CLL) je nejčastější leukémií seniorů na západní polokouli. Existuje několik léčebných přístupů CLL, i přesto však CLL zůstává neléčitelnou chorobou. Vývoj nových léčebných přístupů je proto velmi žádaný. Naše předběžná data ukazují, že leukemické buňky CLL pacientů a Eµ-TCL1 myší mají upregulovaný UPR signaling, což koreluje s retencí povrchových receptorů v ER či jejich degradací. Také jsme zjistili, že konvenční CLL terapie pravděpodobně zvyšuje ER stres, čímž může přispívat k progresi onemocnění kvůli snížené dostupnosti terapeutických cílů. Tato data naznačují, že  terapie mířená proti mechanismům ER stresu by mohla obnovit membránovou prezentaci antigenů a tím zlepšit průběh CLL onemocnění. Naše data také ukazují, že lidské i myší CLL buňky everexprimují antiapoptické proteiny FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2) a API5 (apoptosis inhibitor 5). Inhibice FGF2/API5 signalizace by mohla senzitizovat CLL buňky k buněčné smrti a představovat tak nový terapeutický cíl v léčbě CLL.\nV tomto projektu využijeme primárních lidských a myších CLL buněk a také Eµ-TCL1 myší za účelem vývoje nového léčebného přístupu CLL, cílícího na specifické mechanismy ER stresu.",

Jelikož je patrné, že migrační mechanismus podporuje metastatické šíření, úspěšná antimetastatická léčba může redukovat potřebu vysokých dávek cytotoxické terapie užívané k zabránění metastatické diseminace, což může zvýšit kvalitu života pacienta. Cílení na mitochondrie může být racionální strategií v migrastatických a antimetastatických přístupech léčby rakoviny. Pentamethiniové soli vázající se na mitochondriální kardiolipin (PMS) vykazují slibné migrastatické vlastnosti. Akumulují se v mitochondriích nádorových buněk a zároveň snižují jejich pohyblivost, migraci a invazivní potenciál. Cílení na mitochondrie má však určitá omezení. Nádorové buňky jsou flexibilní a mohou kompenzovat ztrátu mitochondriální produkce ATP exogenním mitochondriálním transferem z hostitelských buněk v mikroprostředí nádoru. Ukázalo se, že přenesené mitochondrie mění metabolismus recipientních buněk a tento proces byl popsán jak mezi nádorovými buňkami, tak mezi nádorovými buňkami a stromálními buňkami v nádorovém mikroprostředí.",

Dle histopatologických prognostických markerů (klinické stádium, histologický typ, grade a invaze do lymfovaskulárního prostoru) se pacientky stratifikují do skupin s nízkým nebo vysokým rizikem recidivy. Zatímco u pacientek s nízkým rizikem recidivy je za adekvátní terapeutický postup považována hysterektomie s bilaterální adnexektomií, u vysoce rizikových případů je doporučována stagingová pánevní a paraaortální lymfadenektomie včetně chirurgické intervence a adjuvantní léčby (radio/chemoterapie). Přesto dochází až u 20 % pacientek s nízkým rizikem k recidivě onemocnění a adjuvantní léčba by pro ně tedy byla přínosem. Proto je v současné době kladen důraz na identifikaci nových přístupů, které by zpřesnili stratifikaci pacientek dle skutečného rizika recidivy. Jedním z těchto přístupů je sledování mutačního stavu genu pro polymerázu epsilon (POLE), imunohistochemické vyšetření proteinu p53 a vyšetření defektu proteinů tzv. mismatch rapir systému (MMR deficience). Jako slibné se také jeví sledování mutačního stavu L1-CAM a hodnocení positivity estrogenových (ER) a progesteronových (PR) receptorů. Dalším přístupem je použití technik sekvenování nové generace (NGS), kterými lze nejenom detekovat mutační stav uvedených genů a mikrosatelitovou instabilitu související s MMR deficiencí, ale také vyšetřit další geny a stanovit komplexní molekulární profil nádoru. Cílem projektu je provést komplexní vyšetření L1-CAM, ER, PR, p53, MMR a POLE pomocí imunohistochemických molekulárně biologických přístupů, včetně cíleného sekvenování genů asociovaných s tímto onemocněním.

Cirkulární RNA (circRNA) jsou podtypem ncRNA a se svou délkou až 4 000 páru bází patří pod skupinu lncRNA. Současný rychlý vývoj sekvenačních metod a bioinformatických přístupů pomohl identifikovat tisíce eukaryotických circRNA a změny exprese těchto molekul byly nalezeny v různých vývojových stadiích, fyziologických podmínkách a orgánových systémech, včetně nervového systému. Jejich důležitá role byla prokázána také ve vývoji gliomu. Tyto molekuly jsou výsledkem nekanonické sestřihové události zvané zpětný sestřih, ve které je 3' konec transkriptu kovalentně spojen s 5' koncem, což vede k vytvoření spojité smyčky. Bylo zjištěno, že circRNA v těle mohou reverzibilně vázat specifické miRNA, čímž jim brání ve vazbě na jejich vlastní molekulární cíle. Tímto způsobem lze regulovat posttranskripční umlčování některých genů zprostředkované molekulami miRNA. Na základě tohoto jevu jsou circRNA označovány jako tzv. „sponge“ miRNA. Tato schopnost, společně s jejich stabilitou v tělních tekutinách může vést k předpokladu, že circRNA mohou být potenciálními biomarkery pro predikci rizika nádorového onemocnění včetně gliomu. Předkládaný projekt se zaměřuje na globální profilování circRNA, funkční in vitro a in vivo analýzy včetně použití technologie CRISPR/Cas9. Cílem není pouze srovnání globálních expresních profilů circRNA ve tkáni a likvoru pacientů s gliomem a nenádorových pacientů, ale také celkové hlubší porozumění biologii circRNA, objasnění circRNA-miRNA-mRNA signálních drah a navržení nových možných molekulárních cílů v léčbě gliomů. Výstupem budou také circRNA diagnostické panely schopné precizně stratifikovat pacienty s gliomem dle jejich diagnózy a pacienty s glioblastomem dle jejich terapeutické o",

Jsou lokálně invazivní, recidivující a zapříčiňují významnou morbiditu i mortalitu. Zvládání těchto onemocnění v klinické praxi je často nedokonalé, kvůli nedostatečné znalosti molekulárních mechanismů stojících za vznikem a progresí mesenchymálních nádorů prsu. V tomto projektu si klademe za cíl objasnění těchto mechanismů, pochopení vývoje od normálního po nádorový fibroblast a popis nových biomarkerů a potenciálních kandidátů vhodných k cílené léčbě prostřednictvím studia vývojových vztahů zdravých a patologických fibroblastů. Za tímto účelem provedeme transkriptomické srovnání fibroblastů ze zdravého prsu a buněk mesenchymálních nádorů prsu pomocí sekvenování RNA jednotlivých buněk, následované histologickou fenotypizací a funkčními in vitro experimenty. Skrze rozluštění heterogenity a plasticity normálních a nádorových fibroblastů prsu tento projekt posune hranice poznání nádorů měkkých tkání, přispěje k odhalení nových biomarkerů a terapeutických cílů a vydláždí cestu k personalizované léčbe vzácných mesenchymálních nádorů prsu.",

Nositelné senzory měřící fyziologické parametry jsou čím dál dostupnější jak pro vědecké využití, tak pro širokou veřejnost. Zvyšující se dostupnost nositelných senzorů je velkou výhodou pro výzkum jednak z toho důvodu, že takový senzor je relativně malý ve srovnání se stolními přístroji, nevyžaduje drátové připojení a nebrání tak participantovi v pohybu. Senzory také většinou připomínají denně používané předměty (hodinky, náramky či prstýnky) a tak je jejich použití příjemnější ve srovnání se stolními přístroji. Další velkou výhodou je to, že měření nemusí být uskutečněno v laboratoři, ale může probíhat v prostředí, které je pro daný výzkum přirozené a scénář sestavený pro měření může být dynamický. Je tedy velmi žádoucí otestovat přesnost měření takovýchto nositelných senzorů. \nKonkrétním cílem této validační studie je stanovit přesnost měření elektrodermální aktivity chytrým prstýnkem od firmy Moodmetric, který je volně dostupný na trhu. Srovnání bude probíhat proti certifikovanému přístroji BrainAmp ExG MR s připojeným GSR (galvanic skin response) senzorem. Pro měření tepové frekvence a její variability bude využit model sportester Gramin Forerunner55 ve srovnání se stolním EKG monitorem.

Objev hypoxií indukovatelných faktorů (HIF) jako hlavních hybných sil buněčné adaptace na hypoxii vedl k vývoji řady inhibitorů HIF dráhy. Doposud však nebyla schválena žádná činidla, která inhibují aktivitu HIF.

HPO je tedy tudíž závažně život ohrožující onemocnění. Protože farmakoterapie je u HPO pouze symptomatická, byly vyvinuty psychoterapie specificky zaměřené na léčbu této poruchy. Mezi těmito přístupy se Dialektická behaviorální terapie (DBT) dosud jeví jako jedna z nejúčinnějších. Největším problém DBT je však vysoké procento pacientů, kteří léčbu nedokončí (v průměru kolem 28%). Mezi další možné způsoby léčby HPO patří repetitivní transkraniální magnetická stimulace (rTMS). Tato metoda léčby přináší podle dosavadní literatury rychlé zlepšení v oblastech emoční dysregulace a impulzivity, avšak trvání efektů zřejmě není delší než několik týdnů nebo měsíců. Cílem tohoto projektu je překonat největší problémy obou terapeutických přístupů (vysoký dropout v DBT a krátké trvání efektu rTMS) jejich zkombinováním. 48 pacientů s HPO podstoupí 3 týdny prefrontální aktivní nebo shamové rTMS a poloviny z těchto pacientů dále také podstoupí komplexní DBT program trvající 24 týdnů. V několika časových bodech budeme měřit behaviorální i neurální efekty intervencí. Projekt je jedním z prvních vůbec, které se zabývají možností rTMS augmentovaná psychoterapie, a zodpoví současně na otázky, zda je aktivní prefrontální rTMS účinnější než shamová rTMS (placebo) a zda může být efekt DBT augmentován pomocí rTMS. Projekt tak zároveň může přinést možnost využívání rTMS jako krátké efektivní intervence u pacientů, kteří čekají na DBT, protože čekací jsou velmi dlouhé. Projekt rovněž zahrnují hodnocení neurálních změn po rTMS a DBT intervencích a měření v několika časových bodech nám umožní sledovat dlouhodobý vývoj efektu intervencí. Tato studie tudíž přinese několik unikátních příspěvků do současnému poznání ohledně léčby HPO a může významně zlepšit možnosti léčby HPO.",

   "annotation": "Pandemie SARS-CoV-2 ochromila na začátku roku 2020 celý svět. Od té doby se postupně střídají různé varianty koronaviru, kdy v současnosti ve světě převládá varianta omicron, která způsobuje odlišné klinické příznaky. Především nebývá napadena plicní tkáň jako u všech předešlých variant koronaviru. Stále častěji jsou zaznamenávány případy lidí s tzv. post-covidovým syndromem, tedy lidí, kteří se vyléčili z onemocnění COVID-19, avšak přesto se potýkají s různými zdravotními problémy. Pro výzkum COVID-19 bychom chtěli použít jedinečnou sadu více než 4 000 vzorků od 90 zemřelých po COVID-19, kteří byly infikováni variantami beta a delta. Během pandemie od října 2020 do dubna 2021 byly odebrány vzorky.  Projekt se primárně zaměří na sledování výskytu viru SARS-CoV-2 ve tkáních, orgánech a tělních tekutinách. Bude určena virová nálož v jednotlivých vzorcích a případný typ mutace viru. Vzhledem k nezastupitelné roli ACE2 receptoru při SARS-CoV-2 infekci bude velká pozornost věnována genu pro tento receptor. Především bude sledována míra jeho exprese v různých orgánech a identifikovány případné polymorfismy. V neposlední řadě se projekt bude věnovat také obalovému proteinu E, který je součástí SARS-CoV-2. Protein E tvoří pentamerní strukturu nazývanou viroporin, která se začleňuje do buněčných membrán napadených buněk a vytváří iontové kanály poškozující funkce buněk. Projekt bude proto sledovat výskyt viroporinu E ve vybraných orgánech a pokusí se určit vztah mezi morfologickými a fyziologickými změnami na orgánech vzhledem k obsahu viroporinu E. Celá studie bude probíhat na unikátním souboru 170 mrtvých těl (včetně kontrol) s využitím RT qPCR, NGS sekvenování, fluorescenční a elektronové mikroskopie, histologických vyšetření, apod. Data získaná v rámci projektu přinesou významné a komplexní informace ohledně distribuce SARS-CoV-2 v těle, pomohou vysvětlit patologické změny nalézané na postižených orgánech či osvětlit míru závažnosti infekce u různých jedinců.",

Doposud není žádná léčba, která by tuto komplikaci dokázala spolehlivě vyřešit. Jedním z nejnovějších přístupů, jak léčit postradiační xerostomii je použití mezenchymálních kmenových buněk (MSC), které jsou aplikovány do postižených slinných žláz. Výsledky této terapie v klinických zkoušeních neodpovídají dobrému efektu léčby na zvířecích modelech. Z toho je odvoditelná potřeba dalšího výzkumu mechanismů, které brání žádoucím diferenciačním trajektoriím MSC.\n\nCíl studie: \nproof-of-concept study sloužící k precisnímu a reprodukovatelnému zmapování klinického stavu nemocných, zmapování molekulárně-patologického pozadí v prostředí slinných žláz, které může být příčinou narušení diferenciačních trajektorií a studium diferenciace MSC a jejích podmínek diferenciace in vitro v prostředí proteinů identifikovaných imunohistochemicky.\n\nMateriál a metody: \n100-120 pacientů bude zařazeno do studie. Bude měřena sekreční aktivita slinných žláz, mapována ultrasonografická struktura, chemické složení slin a kvalita života pacientů s postradiační xerostomií, konkomitačně provedení retrospektivní imunohistochemické studie existujícím materiálu na 45 vzorků slinných žláz po radioterapii a srovnání proti vzorkům slinných žláz bez provedené radioterapie. Bude provedena studie diferenciace ověřených linií MSC získaných lipoaspirací v prostředí proteinů potenciálně blokujících správnou diferenciační trajektorii.

Takové sledování je často ztížené kvůli nejednotnému formátu výsledků a nutnosti pracovat s velkými tabulkami. V návaznosti na naše úspěšné snahy o vytvoření nástroje pro vyhodnocování NGS dat z panelového sekvenování chceme v předkládaném projektu vytvořit platformu pro integraci výsledků různých genomických metod s údaji o průběhu onemocnění, které jsou shromažďovány při rutinních kontrolách pacientů. To může být výhodné především pro monitoring pacientů s chronickým, například lymfoproliferativním, onemocněním. Součástí projektu bude vytvoření online platformy pro interaktivní vizualizaci genomických dat v průběhu lymfoproliferací, její využití při analýze vybraných medicínských problémů (například analýzy definovaných skupin pacientů, hodnocení dynamiky genomických profilů v závislosti na léčebných strategiích apod.) a zhodnocení jejího přínosu pro rutinní klinickou praxi.",

   "annotation": "Alzheimerova choroba (AD) je progresivní neurodegenerativní porucha postihující starší populaci na celém světě. Vyskytují se u ní obvykle dva patologické rysy: 1) extracelulární beta-amyloidní plaky (Aß) a 2) intraneuronální Tau obsahující neurofibrilární spleti (P-Tau). 23 % světové populace je nositelem genu APOE4, kódujícího Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), který je největším genetickým rizikovým faktorem pro rozvoj sporadické formy AD. Hlavní hypotézou patologie ApoE4 u AD je, že přispívá k akumulaci Aß a P-Tau. Klinické studie, jejichž cílem bylo zabránit ukládání P-Tau nebo Aß, však neprokázaly účinnost v léčbě AD. To naznačuje, že agregace proteinů pravděpodobně není příčinou, ale spíše důsledkem neznámých mechanismů, které nakonec vedou k patologii AD. Za povšimnutí stojí, že kognitivně zdraví nositelé APOE4 mají zvýšenou hladinu buněčných volných kyslíkových radikálů (ROS) a narušenou hipokampální neurogenezi, což jsou jevy pozorované i u AD. Zvýšené hladiny ROS vedou k depozici Aß, které následně zvyšují produkci ROS, a vytvářejí tak začarovaný kruh. Při fyziologických hladinách však ROS hrají roli druhých poslů regulujících řadu signálních drah. Mnohé z nich jsou zapojené v řízení neurální diferenciace, depozice Aß a fosforylace Tau. Předpokládáme, že chronické zvýšení hladiny ROS způsobené ApoE4 moduluje klíčové signální dráhy řídící tyto procesy, což vede k rozvoji a postupu AD. Věříme, že kombinací citlivých analytických metod, jedinečného modelu cerebrálních organoidů založeného na kmenových buňkách a silné odborné znalosti v oblasti neurodiferenciace, ROS signálování a AD, budeme schopni identifikovat nové mechanismy, kterými ApoE4 přispívá k rozvoji AD. Tyto data pak bude možné využít při hledání nových cílů pro terapeutické intervence.",

Existují však malé fragmenty, zejména u tříštivých nitrokloubních zlomenin, které nelze běžnými způsoby fixovat. Otázka zní: „Je možné použít ke spojení malých fragmentů kosti injektovatelné resorbovatelné kostní lepidlo, které po vytvrdnutí v kombinaci s vnitřní fixací umožní okamžité zatěžování poraněné končetiny?“ Hypotéza projektu tedy spočívá v injekční aplikaci nově vyvinutého vstřebatelného „samotuhnoucího“ kostního adheziva ve formě polotekuté pasty na tříštivé zlomeniny tak, aby se malé fragmenty kosti spojily dohromady jako puzzle a při doplnění o vnitřní osteosyntézu tak bylo umožněno prakticky okamžité plné zatěžování poraněné kosti, respektive přidruženého kloubu a tím nevznikly trvalé následky prodělané nitrokloubní zlomeniny. Kostní lepidlo modifikované bioadhezivy během tuhnutí při fyziologických podmínkách fixuje zlomeninu, pomalu se vstřebává a zároveň uvolňuje produkty hydroxyapatitu, čímž nastartuje primární hojení kosti, na jehož konci bude kompletně resorbované adhezivum, pevně zhojená kost bez nitrokloubních schodků a pacient připravený k okamžité rehabilitaci. Toto kostní adhezivum se dá využít nejen k léčbě zlomenin, ale vzhledem k jeho vlastnostem jej lze použít i při artrodézách či k výplni kostních cyst.\nCílem projektu je aktivně reagovat na klinickou potřebu nového „samotuhnoucího“ kostního lepidla kombinujícího biologickou rozložitelnost, optimální mechanické vlastnosti a minimálně invazivní aplikaci injekcí a zlepšit tak hojení kostí. Dílčím cílem projektu je syntéza již vyvinutého injektovatelného kostního cementu na bázi fosforečnanu vápenatého a biodegradovatelného termosenzitivního polymeru pro minimálně invazivní aplikaci. Inovací bude jeho modifikace přírodními látkami zlepšujícími adhezi cementu s kostí za fyziologických podmínek (dopamine, phosphoserine, chitosan), která není v současné době ideální.",

Je zřejmé, že in vitro kultivované chondrocyty nenabízely pacientům konečné řešení. Proto bychom jako nový přístup k léčbě defektů a degenerace chrupavky chtěli provést výzkum a vývoj stimulace chondrocytů přímo v chrupavce. Vlastní samo-léčení aktivované přímo v chrupavce, nově vyvinutá stimulace chondrocytů in situ by měla zvrátit deprivaci chondrocytů, omladit a obnovit jejich původní funkci a stimulovat jejich klonální růst.",

Endometrióza je onemocnění, při kterém se rozptýlená menstruační tkáň postupně rozrůstá mimo dělohu a způsobuje silné bolesti a neplodnost. Živé buňky endometriální tkáně unikají imunitnímu dozoru, což vede k akutnímu zánětu v peritoneálním mikroprostředí a významně zvýšenému riziku vzniku karcinomů vaječníků a prsu.\nGamma-delta T buňky představují efektorové lymfocyty vrozené imunity zapojené do imunitního dozoru jako první linie obrany proti infekcím a nádorům; tvoří méně než 10% T buněk v periferní krvi, ale nacházejí se také v tkáních včetně kůže, tenkého střeva, dělohy a vaječníků. Nedávno jsme jako první prokázali u pacientek s endometriózou přítomnost gamma-delta T lymfocytů v peritoneální tekutině a párovaných vzorcích periferní krve (Hudecek R. et al, Frontiers Immunol. 2021). Popsali jsme také prominentní vrozenou cytotoxickou reaktivitu gamma-delta T buněk izolovaných ze zdravých dárců proti KLE, RL-95 a Ishikawa endometriálním buněčným liniím.\nNaším cílem je u pacientek s endometriózou analyzovat poruchy imunitní funkce rezidentních a rekrutovaných buněk zapojených do obrany v peritoneu. Také jsme detekovali populace endometriálních stromálních buněk, které v P2-P3 vykazovaly morfologii fibroblastů a fenotypem se podobaly mesenchymálním kmenovým buňkám (MSC). Za druhé, provedeme detailní analýzy interakcí gamma-delta T lymfocytů v endometriálním mikroprostředí s dendritickými buňkami, primárními stromálními buňkami, mezenchymálními kmenovými buňkami a makrofágy asociovaných s endometriózou, které pomohou objasnit molekulární mechanismy patologických změn endometria a určit biomarkery, které by mohly být v budoucnu součástí imunoterapeutických intervencí.",

Nepříznivá prognóza a krátký medián přežití po resekci a radio/chemoterapii kratší než 12 měsíců jsou způsobeny časnou recidivou nádoru. Imunitní mikroprostředí GBM nádoru je proto slibným cílem při vývoji průlomových imunoterapeutických léčebných postupů, zejména pak gamma-delta (γδ) T efektorové lymfocytů, u kterých jsme již ukázali vysokou reaktivitu na GBM nádor. Nedávno jsem identifikovali tumor-infiltrující γδ T buňky (TIL) v nádorech GBM u více než 75% pacientů. Potvrdili jsme významně rozdílné exprese proteinů kontrolních bodů B7-H1 a B7-H3, které odkazují na charakteristické změny hematoencefalické bariéry u GBM pacientů.\nNaším cílem je studovat funkce γδ TIL lymfocytů, popsat jejich single-cell expresní profily, rozlišit GBM reaktivní vs nereaktivní populace na základě profilování chromatinu a genové regulace vybraných transkripčních faktorů včetně N-Myc. Cílem je identifikovat proteiny specificky exprimované na γδ TIL, provést silencing těchto genů a následně provést ověření v cytotoxických esejích. Naše výsledky dále popisují populace plazmacytoidních dendritických buněk (pDC) infiltrovaných v GBM nádoru u většiny pacientů. Plánujeme definovat jejich expresní profily, funkce a případné zapojení pDC v relapsu z důvodu rezistence na chemoterapii. Dalším úkolem bude získání indukovaných pluripotentních kmenových (iPSC) γδ buněk jako nového zdroje adoptivní buněčné terapie GBM. Bude zkoumáno několik strategií izolace and expanse klonů od zdravých dárců a také autologních buněk.\nOčekáváme, že odhalíme některé ze základních mechanismů vedoucích k progresi nádoru a nabídneme možnosti translace iPSC a TIL buněk v budoucích klinických aplikacích GBM imunoterapie.",

Jedním z hlavních společných projevů chronických onemocnění je omezení pohybové aktivity v důsledku přetrvávající dušnosti, které limituje každodenní život většiny nemocných. Mezi hlavní příčiny dušnosti patří slabost respiračního svalstva. Inovativní způsob, který může lépe popisovat stav dechového svalstva, představuje Test of Incremental Respiratory Endurance (TIRE), který se, na rozdíl od běžně používaných ústních tlaků, primárně zaměřuje na vytrvalost dechového svalstva, což je z hlediska běžných denních aktivit přínosnější. TIRE je popisováno řadou inovativních parametrů, které se v běžné klinické praxi v evropských zemích nepoužívají, a tudíž neexistují žádné normativní hodnoty pro zdravou populaci. Vytvoření normativních hodnot parametrů TIRE pro českou populaci přinese možnosti kvantifikace vytrvalosti dechového svalstva. Díky těmto hodnotám bude následně možné nejen lépe popsat funkční stav respiračního svalstva, ale také nastavit ideální parametry respiračního tréninku, což v současnosti možné není, protože normativní hodnoty parametrů TIRE neexistují a používané parametry ústních tlaků neposkytují pro tento účel dostatek informací. Tento projekt si dává za cíl změřit a vytvořit referenční hodnoty parametrů TIRE pro českou populaci (30 mužů a 30 žen v každé dekádě od 20 do 80 let) a tím nabídnout lepší možnosti hodnocení výkonnosti, resp. míry oslabení respiračního svalstva u pacientů s chronickými onemocněními (skupina 1). Stejným způsobem budou kvantifikovány dopady onemocnění Covid-19 na stav respiračního svalstva u lidí se symptomatickým průběhem (skupina 2).",

Navíc je progrese plicní fibrózy u růzých pacientů extrémně variabliní a některé typy IPP mají vysoké riziko přesmyku ze stabilizovaného onemocnění do fatálního progresivního fibrotizujícícho fenotypu, známého jako progredující fibrotizující IPP. Vývoj nových léčiv je limitován zásadním nedostatkem znalostí o jejich spouštěcích a udržujících faktorech. V tomto projektu využijeme našich rozsáhlých zkušeností s tkáňovým inženýrstvím, biomateriály a bunečnou biologií a vytvoříme 3D modely IPP, vhodné k modelování chorob a testování léčiv. Zkombinujeme biomateriálové nosiče založené na decelularizované plicní tkáni s lidskými buňkami, a vytvoříme tak 3D modely plicní tkáně. Ustavíme linie lidských pluripotentních kmenových buněk (hiPSC) odvozené od krevních buněk pacientů s IPP, kteří jsou nositeli genetických mutací/variant spojených s IPP nebo trpících progredující fibrotizující formou IPP, a tyto hiPSC diferencujeme do plicních derivátů (plicní epitel, fibroblasty) specifických pro daného pacienta. Kombinací buněk odvozených od hiPSC a decelularizovaných nosičů vznikne „kompletní“ 3D plicní model IPP, kdy všechny buňky v modelu budou nositeli specifické vlastnosti relevantní pro rozvoj IPP, čímž dosáhneme nejrelevantnější aplikovatelnosti modelu. Podobným způsobem využijeme linie lidských embryonálních kmenových buněk (hESC) a vytvoříme „zdravý“ 3D model plicní tkáně, který bude sloužit jako kontrola, a do kterého můžeme vložit primární buňky pacientů s IPP a vytvořit 3D plicní model s „fibrotickým ložiskem“. V projektu ověříme, zda tyto modely mohou být vytvořeny standardizovaným a opakovatelným protokolem založeným na výše zmíněné strategii, a zda tyto modely replikují vlastnosti plicní tkáně ve zdraví a nemoci. Tyto modely budou mít dalekosáhlé aplikace ve výzkumu IPP, personalizaci medicíny a ve farmaceutickém průmyslu.",

Ačkoliv se jedná o relativně malá čísla, jde o jedince v produktivním věku, jejichž prognóza je velice špatná a patogeneze tohoto onemocnění není uspokojivě objasněna. Často se jedná o nekuřáky či o relativně krátce kouřící jednice, lze tedy oproti starším nemocným uvažovat jinou kauzalitu nádorového onemocnění. Většina pacientů v této věkové podskupině je navíc diagnostikována s agresivními formami karcinomu plic. Genetické pozadí karcinomu plic s výskytem u pacientů mladších 40 let je málo prostudované a v literatuře je popsán pouze vyšší výskyt EML4-ALK translokací u nemalobuněčného karcinomu plic a mutací v EGFR genu. Naše preliminární analýzy však odhalily také potenciálně cílitelné mutace v genech pro BRAF, PIK3CA nebo amplifikaci genu HER2. Pokročilá diagnostika genetických aberací by proto u podskupiny pacientů s karcinomem plic do 40 let mohla pomoci identifikovat nové potenciální cíle onkologické léčby. Navrhovaný projekt bude realizován formou multicentrického náboru pacientů, přičemž cílem projektu je komplexní analýza molekulárně genetických změn karcinomů plic s časným výskytem. Snahou bude identifikovat spektrum možných genetických aberací v nádorové tkáni mimo běžně testované drivery (EGFR mutaci a ALK translokaci) pomocí sekvenování nové generace (hotspot onkologický panel, germinální exom, somatický exom, detekce fúzních genů). Získané výsledky by měly nejen rozšířit současnou úroveň vědeckého poznání o etiopatogenezi karcinomu plic, ale významně rozšířit léčebné možnosti v rámci individualizovaných léčebných plánů po vyčerpání standardních léčebných možností u mladých pacientů s karcinomem plic.",

Jedním z autorů RecMap je České národní centrum Evidence-Based Healthcare a Knowledge Translation (CEBHC-KT) se všemi svými mezinárodními centry (České Cochrane centrum, České centrum EBHC, Centrum excelence Joanna Briggs Institute a České GRADE centrum), Institut biostatistiky a analýz, Lékařská fakulta, Masarykova univerzita. V projektu RecMap identifikujeme a klasifikujeme COVID-19 doporučené postupy, vyhodnocujeme jejich důvěryhodnost a poskytujeme doporučení zúčastněným stranám. RecMap představuje více než 1200 předem zkontrolovaných doporučení pro oblast klinické praxe, veřejného zdravotnictví a zdravotní politiky. RecMap se primárně zaměřuje na zdravotnictví, ale protože nejméně 450 doporučení se týká adolescentů a veřejného zdravotnictví, veřejnost bude také těžit z dostupných doporučení týkajících se zdraví. Způsob prezentace doporučení pro laiky musí být přizpůsoben jejich konkrétním potřebám. I přes pokyny vyvinuté v Guidelines International Network (GIN), jednom z našich blízkých spolupracovníků, neexistují žádné důkazy na úrovni randomizované kontrolované studie (RCT), které by zjišťovaly optimální formát předkládání doporučení v prostém (laickém) jazyce (PLR) občanům, zejména dospívajícím a rodičům, kteří rozhodují o zdraví svých dětí, například o jejich očkování či dodržování hygienických opatření. Projekt si proto klade za cíl vyvinout a otestovat metodiku pro  tvorbu prosté jazykové verze prioritních doporučení pro veřejný zájem adolescentů, rodičů a obecné dospělé populace v České republice v návaznosti s zkušenosti získané v souvislosti s onemocněním COVID-19. Metodika bude připravena tak, aby mohla být využita pro různá onemocnění, zejména infekční s pandemickým výskytem.",

   "annotation": "Sepse představuje jednu z nejčastějších příčin úmrtí na jednotkách intenzivní péče pro děti i dospělé navzdory moderním terapeutickým postupům. Termín novorozenecká sepse je užíván k označení systémového onemocnění bakteriálního, virového nebo plísňového původu, které je spojené s významnými hemodynamickými změnami a klinickou manifestací ústící ve značnou morbiditu a mortalitu. Běžné laboratorní testy jako kultivace hemokultur, indexy leukocytů, reaktanty akutní fáze a srdeční frekvence mají u novorozenecké sepse limity v diagnostické přesnosti, zejména nízkou pozitivně prediktivní hodnotu. Tyto limity v kombinaci s nejednoznačnými klinickými příznaky, které se navíc překrývají s projevy nezralosti často nutí neonatology k vyloučení sepse z diferenciálně diagnostického postupu. Avšak je-li antibiotická terapie nasazena až při kompletních klinických projevech, je prognóza nepříznivá, na druhou stranu liberální antibiotická politika vede ke zvyšování rezistence mikroorganismů. V rámci předkládané studie bude výzkumná kohorta důsledně charakterizována pomocí standardních biochemických markerů zánětu (CRP, procalcitonin, prozánetlivé cytokiny), a pomocí metagenomických analýz střevního a krevního mikrobiomu. Profily cirkulující miRNA v séru budou analyzovány pomocí sekvenování nové generace a korelovány s se standardními biochemickými markery s cílem zhodnotit použitelnost miRNA jako časných ukazatelů nástupu a průběhu systémové infekce v krevním oběhu. Cílem je vytvoření panelu diagnostických a prognostických biomarkerů umožňujících podchytit sepsi v době, kdy je dle klinických příznaků nezachytitelná a předpovědět prognózu onemocnění.",

Bylo prokázáno, že některé miRNA jsou asociované s rozvojem MS, nebo jsou schopné odlišit pacienty s různým subtypem onemocnění.

However, in vitro generated retinal cells are often poorly differentiated with impaired functionality demonstrated by not fully developed photoreceptor outer segments and less synaptic connectivity, which can be contributed to the lack of natural instructive signals that is normally available in vivo. In this project we aim to address these limitations by introducing instructive signals using photo-stimulation of human retinal cells. We have developed a unique optical device for high-throughput multi-wavelength light illumination of retinal organoids. Our preliminary results clearly indicate that photo-stimulation of differentiating retinal cells leads to enhanced differentiation. The proposed strategy combines the innovative photo-stimulation approach with stem cell biology research, allowing to study photo-induced effects on retinal development from a uniquely different perspective.",

   "annotation": "Primární cilium je organela připomínajích bičík, typicky přítomna na povrchu většiny buněk. Celá desetiletí bylo primární cilium na okraji vědeckého zájmu. To se změnilo až v posledních letech kdy se studium této organely právem stalo jednou z nejaktraktivnějších oblastí buněčné biologie. Primární cilium plní funkci buněčné antény na povrchu buněk - slouží k přenosu signálu z okolí do nitra buňky (dráhy Shh, Wnt, PDGF), čímž hraje nepostradatelnou roli v buněčné odpovědi na podněty z okolí. Problematika regulace cilií není pouze „akademický problém“, ale má velice významný klinický aspekt, jelikož mutace komponent cilií souvisí se vznikem řady chorob a vývojových vad. Tau tubulin kináza 2 (TTBK2) je klíčovým regulátorem tvorby cilií (ciliogeneze) u obratlovců, mutace v TTBK2 genu jsou spojeny s vznikem neurologického onemocnění u lidí (spinocerebrální ataxie typ 11, SCA11). V současné době není přesně známo jakým molekulárním mechanismem TTBK2 reguluje ciliogenezi a zda (a případně jak) je její role v ciliogenezi spojena se vznikem SCA11, tj. zda se jedná o ciliopatii. Cílem tohoto projektu bude pomocí několika přistupů (in vitro kinázová esej, příprava stabilních buněčných linií, studium ciliogeneze pomocí buněčných modelů – RPE-1, HEK 293T) systematicky porovnat „wild type“ TTBK2 s mutatní TTBK2 v několika klíčových parametrech. Dá se očekávat, že získaná data, ať už na molekulární (např. rozdíl či ne ve schopnosti wt and mutatní TTBK2 fosforylovat testovaný substrát) nebo funkční úrovni (např. rozdíl či ne ve schopnosti wt and mutatní TTBK2 regulovat ciliogenezi), přispějí k objasnění role TTBK2 ve vývoji a patofyziologii. Student řešící zmíněnou problematiku bude součástí mladého a dynamického výzkumného týmu s mezinárodními kontakty. Bude moci využít celé plejády metod, od klasických molekulárně-biologických a biochemických přístupů (western blot, PCR, siRNA), přes proteomiku, až k pokročilým mikroskopickým metodám",

Tyto struktury se nacházejí často v oblasti telomer, promotorů onkogenů, a promotorů transkripce a je tedy velmi pravděpodobné, že se mohou uplatňovat v regulaci patologických procesů, včetně nádorového bujení [1, 2] . \nPřírodní látky patří odpradávna k cenným zdrojům v oblasti léčení nebo prevence různých typů onemocnění, včetně nádorových. V klinické praxi je i dnes používána celá řada látek přírodního původu. Mnoho z nich se v praxi uplatnilo jako protinádorová léčiva. Přestože se jedná o poměrně dlouho známá léčiva, stále jsou v onkologii solidních nádorů velmi ceněná a často používaná (např. paklitaxel, vinblastin, etoposid). Mnohé z přírodních látek posloužily také jako inspirace pro chemickou syntézu účinných léčiv s akceptovatelným bezpečnostním profilem. \nKvarterní benzo [c] fenanthridinové alkaloidy (QBA) jsou látky přírodního původu, nacházející se v léčivých rostlinách čeledí Papaveraceae, Fumariaceae a Rutaceae a vykazují řadů nadějných účinků (antimikrobní, antimykotické, protizánětlivé, protinádorové); QBA jsou tedy v poslední době intenzivně zkoumány coby potenciální léčiva a již byly prokázány některé typy interakcí vybraných QBA s konvenčními i nekanonickými formami DNA [3, 4]. Cílem tohoto projektu je studium interakcí QBA a jejich metabolitů a nekanonických forem DNA, jako je G-kvadruplex nebo i-motif. Stabilizace těchto struktur může významným způsobem ovlivnit regulaci transkripce a tedy řadu patofyziologických procesů, včetně kancerogeneze. QBA pro studium těchto interakcí budou izolovány z přírodních zdrojů a jejich metabolity budou připraveny v dostatečném množství biotransformačními reakcemi (metabolismus fáze I a II) a izolovány pomocí semipreparativní chromatografie. Charakterizace a identifikace bude provedena pomocí kapalinové chromatografie s hmotnostní spektrometrií (MS). Interakce QBA a jejich metabolitů bude studována pomocí spektrometrických technik (UV-Vis, fluorescence, cirkulárního dichroismu, MS) a kompetitivní dialýzy. U vysoce interagujících zástupců QBA bude testována cytotoxicita na buněčné úrovni. Objasněním interakcí QBA projekt přispěje k možnému využití QBA jako protinádorových léčiv.",

Na základě vhodně zvolených modelových a do značené míry typizovaných případů ze současné soudnělékařské praxe (střelné poranění, pád z výšky, dopravní nehody) budou studovány, modelovány a identifikovány faktory podílející se na vzniku reálných úrazových stavů skeletárního systému člověka. Předpokladem studia mechanismu vzniku zranění bude celotělové vyšetření mrtvého těla (respektive místa konkrétního zranění) na počítačovém tomografu. Vlastní matematickofyzikální modelování mechanismu vzniku traumatu bude řešeno pomocí analýzy konečných prvků. Tyto výstupy budou konfrontovány s průvodními informacemi případu, s reálnými zjištěními z provedené pitvy a se závěry radiologického vyšetření. V rámci řešení projektu bude vytvořen radiologický protokol pro postmortem celotělové vyšetření lidského těla pomocí spektrálního výpočetního tomografu s duální energií záření, včetně odečtu informací o prvkovém složení v místě traumatického poškození kosti. Tento protokol bude dále optimalizován pro potřeby modelování vzniku úrazů v soudním lékařství. \nMezioborovost projektu spočívá ve spolupráci týmů z Ústavu soudního lékařství LF MU garantujícího směřování projektu k přímému využití jeho výstupů k soudnělékařským účelům, Kliniky radiologie a nukleární medicíny LF MU poskytující technologické a metodické zázemí pro postmortem CT vyšetření lidského těla a erudici při implementaci radiodiagnostických postupů pro účely studie a Laboratoře morfologie a forenzní antropologie PřF MU zajišťující zpracování radiologických dat pro účely analýzy konečných prvku a modelování traumatických situací.",

   "annotation": "Profese představují unikátní formu povolanosti k řešení výzev, s nimiž jsou lidé a společnost konfrontováni. Významnými profesemi jsou pomáhající profese, které směřují k podpoře rozvoje osobnosti člověka (jeho vzdělanosti, zdraví, jeho schopnosti společenského začlenění, jeho psychické i fyzické kondici apod.). Vysoká míra odbornosti profesního výkonu je zajišťována mj. díky provázanosti profesí s vědními a studijními disciplínami pěstovanými na univerzitách – spojnicí mezi nimi je přípravné a další (celoživotní) vzdělávání profesionálů. Profese se nacházejí v tranzici – procházejí změnami způsobenými globálními trendy, resortními politikami, proměnami vědy i technologií a dalšími vlivy. Faktory, které tyto změny působí, mohou být v jednotlivých profesích odlišné, stejně jako obsah těchto změn. V některých oblastech změn dochází k prostupování profesí a v jiných ke vzniku nových profesí. Cílem projektu je zjistit, jakými tranzicemi pomáhající profese procházejí, a navrhnout, jak by se změny mohly promítat do souvisejících studijních oborů na MUNI, resp. na univerzitách obecně. Výzkumem má být zachyceno, jak tranzice mění profese a vztahy mezi nimi (interprofesionalita) a jak vstupují do vztahů mezi obory (interdisciplinarita). V první fázi (2020) bude provedena analýza tranzicí doplněná studiem výzkumné literatury k profesím a studijním oborům. Následně (2021) budou studovány vztahy mezi profesemi a obory, a to s využitím ohniskových skupin a delphi metody. Ve třetí fázi (2022) budou výsledky využity při konstrukci modelů (případů) zachycujících vztahy mezi profesemi a odpovídajícími studijními a vědními obory; problém interprofesionality a interdisciplinarity bude řešen prostřednictvím případových studií. Do jednotlivých fází budou zapojeni akademičtí pracovníci čtyř fakult MUNI a praktikující profesionálové. V prodloužení poznávacího cíle výzkumu je ambicí řešitelů vyvozovat návrhy na koncepční, obsahové, metodologické aj. úpravy přípravného a dalšího vzdělávání profesionálů na univerzitách. Projekt umožní etablovat odbornou platformu, na níž bude možné konfrontovat se s aktuálními problémy vysokého školství, jako jsou studijní neúspěšnost, fluktuace a odchody (drop-out) z profese, oslabení zájmu o další vzdělávání apod.",

Díky rozvoji zobrazovacích metod je možná přesnější a komplexnější diagnostika nádorových onemocnění a hodnocení léčebné odpovědi. Spektrální CT nabízí kromě dynamiky sycení a měření denzit nové možnosti charakterizace ložiskových lézí, což by mohlo přispět k užší diferenciální diagnostice nádorů, odhadu jejich histopatologických subtypů, agresivity a predikci léčebné odpovědi. Další moderní metodou je PET/MR. PET/MR dokáže s velmi vysokou senzitivitou vyloučit již časnou disseminaci nádorového onemocnění. Informace z PET/MR může v kombinaci se spektrálním CT přinést další zpřesnění diferenciální diagnostiky nádorů s ambicí odlišit klinicky relevantní histologické subtypy. Neméně významný pokrok byl učiněn v rozvoji nových sekvencí MR. K diferenciální diagnostice zejména mozkových nádorů lze kromě standardních nativních a postkontrastních sekvencí využít moderní sekvence založené na difuzi (např. IVIM). Integrace nálezů těchto nových diagnostických metod do terapeutického plánu pacienta umožňuje individualizaci postupů v moderní onkologické léčbě. \nMiniinvazivní radiologické intervenční metody mají své nezastupitelné místo v terapii některých nádorových onemocnění, typicky při primárním či sekundárním nádorovém postižení jater. Mezi nejrozšířenější patří ablační metody a transarteriální chemoembolizace. Dynamiku v poslední době zaznamenal rozvoj částic používaných při transarteriální chemoembolizaci, které však dle současných dat dosahují odlišnými mechanismy k podobným výsledků, pravděpodobně se však liší počtem nežádoucích účinků. \nCílem projektu je analýza přínosu specifických diagnostických a terapeutických postupů využívaných v Komplexním onkologickém centru Masarykova onkologického ústavu v Brně ve spolupráci s Fakultní nemocnicí Brno a Fakultní nemocnicí U Svatém Anny. Výzkum bude zaměřen na modality PET/MR, pokročilé sekvence MR (IVIM), spektrální CT, korelace radiologických a molekulárních markerů (miRNA). Výsledky léčby u vybraných diagnóz primárních nádorů jater a sekundárních nádorů jater, u kterých byly využity radiologické intervenční přístupy budou kriticky zhodnoceny ve srovnání s daty z jiných komplexních onkologických center, kde pokročilé metody nebyly dostupné.",

Její zvýšená úroveň je klíčovým mechanismem v některých neurologických onemocněních, včetně epilepsie, a dle zdrojů sehrává roli i v genezi fyziologického déjà vu. Déjà vu je anomální paměťový fenomén, při kterém dochází k neadekvátnímu pocitu familiarity nově zažívané situace. Vyskytuje se u většiny zdravé populace, ale i jako doprovodný jev meziotemporální epilepsie. V těchto onemocněních dominují změny KE a strukturní změny v oblasti hipokampu. Podobný vzorec strukturních a metabolomických změn v temporálních lalocích byl v našich předešlých studiích identifikován i u zdravých osob s déjà vu. Předkládaný projekt má za úkol rozšířit poznatky o roli KE v genezi déjà vu u zdravých jedinců i epileptických pacientů v reakci na vizuální stimulaci. Získané poznatky povedou k lepšímu pochopení excitační rovnováhy u zdravých jedinců i pacientů s neurologickými onemocněními.  \nProjekt B: Alzheimerova nemoc (AN) je nejčastější příčina demence ve stárnoucí populaci. Mírná kognitivní porucha (MKP-AN)  je časné stadium AN. Demence při AN má negativní dopad kvalitu života pacienta i pečovatele a je spojena s významným zvýšením morbidity/mortality. V projektu budeme zkoumat neurální koreláty paměťových poruch u pacientů s MKP-AN. MRI zobrazování mozku v kombinaci s neinvazivní mozkovou stimulací (NIMS) - repetitivní transkraniální magnetickou stimulací (rTMS), slouží jako další nástroj pro odhalení mechanismů kognitivních a behaviorálních symptomů. Pomocí NIMS můžeme navodit změny plasticity a funkce mozku, které mohou dále vést k léčebným účinkům na kognitivní funkce.\nProjekt C: Parkinsonova nemoc (PN) je onemocnění, které souvisí primárně s úbytkem dopaminergních neuronů v substantia nigra. U více než poloviny pacientů s PN se časem rozvine mírná kognitivní porucha (MKP-PN). Tito pacienti mají vyšší riziko demence. PN je nevyléčitelná, lze ale potlačit příznaky a zpomalit její rozvoj. V současné době chybí časný specifický neurozobrazovací biomarker pro PN. Animální studie ukazují potenciál difusního kurtozního zobrazování (DKI). DKI je vhodné pro hodnocení mikrostrukturních změn, např. patologického hromadění proteinů. Nalezení specifického, časného a neinvazivního markeru PN by umožnilo včasnou diagnostiku, zahájení léčby a zlepšení kvality života pacientů.",

Do skupiny primárních intrakraniálních tumorů jsou mimo jiné řazeny nejprevalentnější primární nádory mozku - gliální tumory a nejčastější primární tumory plen mozkových - meningeomy. V našich předchozích projektech jsme sledovali různé histopatologické parametry (celularitu, vaskularitu, proliferační potenciál) u glioblastomu, který je ze skupiny primárních intrakraniálních tumorů nejčastější high grade tumor. Tyto parametry jsme korelovali s parametry na MR (ADC) a zjistili jsme, že na základě hodnot ADC je možné predikovat histologickou povahu nádoru a rozsah infiltrace. V pokračování našeho projektu máme v plánu rozšířit analýzu o další parametry tumoru dle MR, například o hodnocení poměru rozsahu nekrózy a postkontrastně se sytícího lemu, či volumometrii a korelování s histologickým hodnoceným poměrem nekrózy s viabilním nádorovou tkání a jejich vztáhnutí ke klinickým údajům o přežívání a času do progrese onemocnění. Plánujeme se dále zaměřit i na jiné primární tumory mozku, především low-grade gliální tumory a meningeomy. V retrospektivní části analýzy pak budeme zkoumat možnost predikce recidivy gliálních nádorů na základě zobrazovacích metod, případně histologických charakteristik. Zaměříme se také na srovnání metod vyšetřování přítomnosti IDH (isocitrát dehydrogenáza) mutace, která je jedním z nejdůležitějších prognostických faktorů u gliálních tumorů - přítomnost této mutace významně zlepšuje prognózu. \nMožnost predikce biologické povahy na podkladě zobrazovacích metod (MR, CT) plánujeme analyzovat také u meningeálních nádorů, jelikož grading stanovený podle nejnovější WHO klasifikace v praxi ne vždy odpovídá biologickému chování u meningeomů. Sledovat budeme následující parametry - rychlost růstu, četnost recidiv, proliferační potenciál, reakci na terapii.",

Dále rozvíjí a navazuje na projekt 1586/2018 a další projekty podobného zaměření řešené v minulých letech (metronomická a antiangiogenní léčba, individualizovaná terapie). Projekt je v souladu s nejmodernějšími trendy současné onkologie tj. personalizované léčby či „precision oncology“.  Postupy personalizované léčby jsou založeny na podrobném vyšetření konkrétního onemocnění, jeho vývoji v čase (opakované biopsie a biologická analýza) i genetického pozadí pacienta. K tomuto účelu se využívají jak komerčně dostupné, tak „in-house“ akademické postupy založené na molekulárně biologických technologiích. Data jsou podrobena sofistikované bioinformatické analýze, která tvoří neoddělitelnou součást těchto tzv. theranostických přístupů.   V rámci tohoto principu provádíme analýzy biologického materiálu, které zahrnují transkripční profilování, detekce fosforylace receptorových tyrosinkináz a MAP kináz proteomickými metodami a sekvenování nové generace NGS  (whole exome/genome sequencing), detekci specifických translokací/genových fúzí (RNAseq). Panel vyšetření byl v roce 2019 rozšířen o sekvenování metylomu. Koncem tohoto roku je v plánu také zahájení testování vyšetřování mutací cell free DNA z plazmy pacienta.  Získané komplexní informace jsou hodnoceny v rámci pravidelných odborných setkání – tzv. expertního panelu („molecular tumor boardu“), na základě kterého je vydáno konkrétní léčebné doporučení. Dlouhodobým cílem je zlepšení léčebných výsledků u pacientů s vysoce rizikovým nádorovým onemocněním jako jsou děti s refrakterními a relabujícími solidními nádory a non-Hodgkinskými lymfomy (NHL). Toho je možné dosáhnout právě personalizovanými postupy v rámci theranostického principu, jak dokladují naše publikované výsledky. Na základě našich zkušeností je možné personalizovaný léčebný princip aplikovat cca u 60% uvažovaných pacientů. Cílem projektu je komplexní rozvoj theranostického principu a jeho aplikaci u dětí s vysoce rizikovým nádorovým onemocněním a zlepšovat tak úspěšnost léčby. Důraz je kladen také na opakované vyšetření nádorové tkáně téhož pacienta (opakované biopsie při recidivách/progresích, klonální vývoj) a sleduje nejmodernější trendy v onkologii (postupy jako tzv. „liquid dynamic medicine“ a „N-of-1 clinical trials“).",

První studie již byly publikovány, jednalo se však z velké části o animální studie, data na lidských populacích jsou pouze omezené.\nCílem projektu je stanovení parametrů plicní cirkulace pomocí CMR - především Pulmonary Blood Volume a Pulmonary Transit Beats u kardiologických pacientů a určit jejich prospektivní hodnotu.\n\n2) DKMP je nejčastější diagnózou, pro kterou je prováděna srdeční transplantace. Zejména v případech čerstvého záchytu však u 30-50% nemocných může dojít k úpravě funkce levé komory. To je spojeno s příznivou prognózou. Hledání markerů reverzní remodelace levé komory má proto zásadní význam pro prognostickou stratifikaci DKMP.\n\n3) Současná diagnostika srdečních arytmií probíhá v prvé řadě za pomoci standardního 12 svodového EKG záznamu. Doplňující, a neméně důležitou, součástí diagnostiky je i zkoumání intrakardiálních signálů při vlastním elektrofyziologickém vyšetření umožňující přesně identifikovat místo vzniku arytmie v srdeční svalovině. V současné době probíhá analýza intrakardiálních signálů pouze v časové oblasti, tzn. rozměřování a porovnávání signálů, tvorba „local activation time“ map apod.. Analýza signálu ve spektrální oblasti se tedy nabízí jako další možná metoda, kterou lze efektivně diagnostikovat arytmie jak typu „re-entry“, tak především arytmie fokálního charakteru.",

Naproti klasické operativě rukami chirurga je ale pohyblivost endoskopických nástrojů zatím omezená. To při dlouhé a složité operaci může vést k technickým limitacím proveditelnosti některých úkonů nutných pro zdárné dokončení operace endoskopicky. Přínos v endoskopické operativě přinesly robotické systémy, které pomocí počítačových algoritmů převádějí pohyb rukou chirurga na velmi pohyblivé nástroje. Tyto velmi precizní systémy jsou ale finančně velmi náročné a to jak jejich pořízení, tak i následné provozní náklady. Pokrok v současné technice již ale dovoluje miniaturizaci nástrojů a proto vznikají komerčně dostupné robotizované nástroje, které drží operatér v ruce a přímo ovládá jejich robotizovaný pohyb svými prsty. Tyto systémy jsou jednoduché na používání, cenově dostupně s minimálními provozními náklady a oproti robotickému systému i kompaktní. Proto jejich zavedení na naší klinice považujeme za výsadu v České Republice a plánujeme rozšířit jejich zavedení do běžné operativy i pro mladé chirurgy, hledat jejich co možná nejširší využití v denní praxi a spolupracovat s technologickými firmami na jejich zdokonalování.",

Je přitom zřejmé, že pro jeho dosahování jsou charakteristické i biochemické a fyziologické ukazovatele. Holistický pohled na zkoumaný stav si klade za cíl právě tento projekt.\n\nDo studie bude přijato 60 probandů. Všichni budou testování pomocí diagnostického nástroje pro flow DFS-2 (osobnostní dispozice ke stavu flow) a FFS-2 (subjektivní vnímání aktuálního flow).\nV rámci psychologických aspektů budou testovány osobnostní charakteristiky sportovců a subjektivně vnímaná míra psychologického stresu. Projekt nabízí možnost propojení biochemických, fyziologických a psychologických korelátů stresu a porovnání míry zátěže prostřednictvím objektivních metod a vlastního sebeposouzení sportovců. K měření osobnostních charakteristik bude použita metoda Big Five Inventory BFI-44. Subjektivně vnímaná míra stresu bude měřena českou verzí Škály vnímaného stresu PSS-10, která představuje zkrácenou verzi metody Perceived Stress Scale. Oba faktory – osobnost a vnímaná míra stresu -  budou  rovněž přezkoumány ve vztahu k  fenoménu flow.\nJako objektivní metoda stanovení stresu bude využita analýza kortizolu z matrice vlasu. Koncentrace kortizolu ve vlasech (HCC) vykazuje spojení s velkým počtem stavů somatického a duševního zdraví, včetně fyzických stresorů, jako je vytrvalostní cvičení. Pomocí HCC bude u participantů retrospektivně zhodnocena míra zátěže za uplynulých 6 měsíců. Aktuální stav bude vyšetřen na základě stanovení variability srdcového rytmu, jako indikátoru psychického stresu a doplněn měřením míry oxidačního stresu.\n\nSchopnost dosahovat stav flow bude korelována s výstupy psychických, biochemických a fyziologických měření. Zhodnoceny budou osobnostní předpoklady a také možnost nastavení lepší stratifikace tréninku vzhledem k měřeným parametrům.",

Oproti SpO2 ale podává informaci o určité „kyslíkové rezervě“, čili o úrovni hyperoxie. Hodnota ORI koreluje s hodnotou paO2 získanou pomocí analýzy krevních plynů. V anesteziologii je žádoucí navodit určitou míru hyperoxie před úvodem do CA a rutinně se provádí formou tzv. preoxygenace. Empiricky je známo, že některé skupiny pacientů (plicní patologie, obezita) vyžadují jinou formu preoxygenace, např.: preoxygenaci těsnící maskou, delší čas preoxygenace, vyšší průtok vdechované směsi, použití neinvazivní ventilace (NIV) atd. Kontinuálně měřená hodnota ORI by mohla kvantifikovat a optimalizovat postup preoxygenace u různých pacientů. Naopak v intenzivní péči je hyperoxie považována za nežádoucí. U pacientů s nutností oxygenoterapie nebo umělé plicní ventilace, proto kontrolujeme úroveň hyperoxie pomocí analýzy krevních plynů (astrup). Předpokládáme, že kontinuální měření ORI by nám umožňovalo pružněji reagovat na přítomnost hyperoxie u pacientů a tedy rychleji upravit míru podávané oxygenoterapie a tím i omezit množství krevních odběrů (na astrup) u pacientů na JIP.",

V molekulárně-genetické části plánujeme analyzovat rozdíly v genetickém pozadí u pacientů s různou závažnostíhereditárního angioedému (HAE), a to na úrovni DNA i RNA (Mgr. T. Kováčová). Dále budeme pokračovat v analýze sekvenčních změn v nekódujících oblastech (intronech) genu SERPING1 z hlediska jejich vlivu na sestřih mRNA. U modelových genů plánujeme zvyšovat počet indukovaných variant a budeme pokračovat ve sledování jejich vlivu na využití akceptorového nebo donorového místa sestřihu (Mgr. P.

(Mgr. P. Slanina)\nNadále budou sledovány některé klinické a laboratorní aspekty sekundárního imunodeficitu, který se vyvíjejí u dětských pacientů po léčbě rituximabem (Dr. E. Hlaváčková). Budou sledovány i některé změny ve funkcích B-lymfocytů u nemocných s běžným variabilním imunodeficitem (CVID) (Mgr. J Štíchová).\nBude dokončena analýza složení střevního mikrobiomu u imunokompromitovaných pacientů po orgánových transplantacích. Dále bude pokračovat analýza méně diverzních polymikrobiálních vzorků s nízkou náloží vstupní mikrobiální DNA (Mgr. I. Kotásková).\nJako formu výstupů předpokládáme především prezentaci na konferencích, ale též přípravu publikací. Mgr. Kotásková a Mgr. Kováčová by měly předložit doktorskou dizertační práci.",

Parkinsonova choroba, Alzheimerova choroba, epilepsie atd.) představují v současnosti velký inovační potenciál a naději na pomoc při zvládání nemoci a udržení plnohodnotného způsobu života. Zároveň aplikace  technologií přináší i značná sociální a uživatelská rizika. Projekt si klade za cíl analyzovat jak kontext vývoje a podmínek co nejvhodnější aplikace těchto pomůcek, tak také sociologicky popsat možná úskalí zneužití a míru nevyžádané sociální kontroly v prostředí současné personalizované a komercializované medicíny. Z hlediska sociologie je nutné věnovat velkou pozornost procesům aplikace nových technologií a zařízení, včetně etických otázek. Projekt řeší témata autonomie a rozhodování o správném postupu zvládání života s neurokognitivním deficitem s novými technickými zařízeními a také  téma nerovných možností příjemců a poskytovatelů péče spolupodílet se na strategii vlastní léčby, což je v českém kontextu dosud málo reflektováno. Projekt je zaměřen na sociologickou analýzu každodenního života pacientů s Alzheimerovou chorobou a na identifikaci typů technologických pomůcek pro pacienty, které jednak jim samotným pomohou mít svou nemoc pod kontrolou a jednak jen minimálně zasáhnou do jejich osobní autonomie a tělesné integrity při jejich používání. Zaměří se též na minimalizaci sociálního stigmatu viditelných asistenčních a kompenzačních pomůcek. Výzkum by měl dále identifikovat požadavky zdravotní i pacientské asistence a zjistit kritéria komfortního používání pomůcky, jež bude v průběhu projektu postupně vyvinuta i testována. Důraz bude kladen na zpětnou vazbu od uživatelů, pokud jde o funkce technologie tak, aby elektronické zařízení optimálně (charakterem, tvarem, ovládáním, signály, barvou) vyhovovalo jako asistenční a dohledová pomůcka příjemcům péče. Z analýzy a spolupráce na vývoji a testování této technologie bude následně vyplývat návrh unikátního asistenčního zařízení, které bude usnadňovat život pacientům i okolním subjektům zapojeným do léčby (rodina, asistenti, lékař).",

V přechozích obdobích byly vytvářeny a implementovány doporučené postupy v péči o osoby s nehojící se ránou. Proveden byl rozsáhlý průzkum zaměřený na proces hodnocení nehojících se ran v klinické praxi (u poskytovatelů akutní lůžkové péče, domácí péče a pracovišť sociálních služeb). Následně byly hodnoceny příčiny vzniku sororigenních ran a psychometrické vlastnosti škál pro hodnocení rizika vzniku tlakových lézí. Z předchozích projektů vyplynuly nedostatky v hodnocení nehojících se ran i v nedostatečné erudici zdravotnických pracovníků v přímé péči v managementu ran a jejich identifikaci. V předchozích projektech byla věnována pozornost zejména dekubitálním lézím jako nejčastějším nehojícím se ranám. V roce 2019 již byla věnována pozornost také dalším ranám mimo tlakové (pergamenová kůže, inkontinenční dermatitida) a také nákladovosti jejich prevence a péče. V realizovaném projektu v roce 2019 se jedná o multicentrickou observačně deskriptivní studii s prvky intervenční studie zaměřenou na validaci a klinické využití nových objektivizujících škál pro hodnocení ran (GLOBIAD a ISTAP). V roce 2020 by projektová činnost plynule navazovala. Projektové aktivity navazují na odbornou činnost garanta projektu (členka výboru ČSLR, výboru EWMA, výboru EPUAP). Cíle projektu zahrnují zvýšení odborných kompetencí všeobecných sester v managementu ran v intenzivní péči. Projekt bude pokračovat jako multidimenzionální, propojuje specifické oblasti péče o rány (prevenci, diferenciální diagnostiku a léčbu ran v IP) v podmínkách tzv. neposkytnuté, či nerealizované péče. Na základě projektových aktivit jsou získávána relevantní data, epidemiologické zhodnocení u konkrétních poskytovatelů péče. v roce 2020 budou do projektu zapojeni další 2 studenti DSP.",

Simulační scénáře s tématikou emergentní péče mohou být užitečným nástrojem k tomu, aby si účastníci simulace zvykli činit rychlá             a správná klinická rozhodnutí, byli schopni si vybudovat myšlenkové vzorce diferenciální diagnostiky a kritického uvažování, získali orientaci ve stresových situacích, naučili se kooperovat a komunikovat v rámci mezioborového týmu             a zároveň simulační scénář umožňuje poskytnout okamžitou zpětnou vazby k výkonům participantů. Model učení dospělých zdůrazňuje, že profitují zejména právě z osobní zkušeností (hands-on experience), cíleného procvičování (deliberate practice) teoretických znalostí a správně podané zpětné vazby. Přestože nemůže simulace nahradit zkušenosti z klinické praxe, může být výborným nástrojem pro získávání zkušeností bez ohrožení bezpečnosti pacientů.Medicínské chyby a faktory suboptimální péče, zjištěné v rámci simulačních scénářů postgraduálních účastníků, mají  repetitivní charakter a lze je použít jako sledované učební výstupy pro pregraduální klinickou výuku.",

Navrhovaný model unikátním způsobem modeluje časná „presymptomatická“ stádia PD, čímž poskytuje nástroj pro studium časných diagnostických ukazatelů PD a pro budoucí vývoj inovativních chorobu modifikujících („disease modifying“) léčiv, např. neuroprotektivních. Součástí projektu je i hodnocení jednoho kandidátního léčiva tohoto typu (baicalein, flavonoid šišáku bajkalského, Scutellaria baicalensis).\nExpozice pesticidům je klinicky asociována s pozdějším rozvojem idiopatické PD. Navrhovaný myší model proto spočívá v intranazální aplikaci pesticidu rotenonu a vychází z dobře klinicky i preklinicky dokladovaného předpokladu, že patologický proces začíná v periferním nervovém systému a postupně progreduje až do bazálních ganglií. Rotenonový model založený na dlouhodobé intragastrické aplikaci velmi malých dávek byl již úspěšně validován. Tento projekt navrhuje model založený na klinicky relevantnější intranazální expozici tomuto environmentálnímu toxinu.\nProjekt využívá tří základních metodických přístupů – behaviorálního testování PD-podobného fenotypu, zobrazování parametrů difúze molekul tkáně vody (zejména kurtózy dufúze, DKI) pomocí magnetické rezonance (MRI) a imunohistochemického potvrzení patologických procesů. Zobrazování kurtózy difúze je hlavním datovým výstupem projektu, jehož výsledky jsou snadno přenositelné i do klinické praxe, neboť se jedná o neinvazivní metodu. Před tím, než bude možné ji začít používat diagnosticky, je ale nutné odhalit patologické procesy, které stojí za změnami signálu.",

Alternativou může být stanovení kortisolu ve vlasové matrici – jeden vzorek vlasů může pokrýt delší časový interval produkce a ukládání kortisolu v organismu. Hladiny vlasového kortisolu tak mohou významně přispět ke zlepšení diagnózy a léčby zejména u pacientů se substituční terapií nebo s ektopickou produkcí ACTH.  Dále mohou sloužit k monitorování pacienta nebo k retrospektivnímu určení progrese onemocnění. Vzhledem k tomu, že žádný dlouhodobý marker kortisolové produkce není k dispozici, mohla by analýza vlasového kortisolu pomocí kapalinové chromatografie s hmotnostní spektrometrií pomoci zlepšit celkový stav hyperkortizolických pacientů.",

Jedná se o skupinu onemocnění, jejichž průběh je značně heterogenní, s celým spektrem projevů a s variabilní mírou agresivity nemoci. Velkou výzvou je časná diagnostika pacientů s potenciálně závažnou formou IBD. Přestože jsou k dispozici kritéria pro odhad nepříznivé prognózy pacientů, tak nejsou dostatečná pro spolehlivý a přesný odhad vývoje onemocnění či léčebné odpovědi. U některých pacientů s nepříznivými prognostickými faktory nakonec nedochází k rozvoji závažných symptomů, zatím co u pacientů s původně příznivým výhledem může být situace opačná. Poptávka po přesných a neinvazivních biomarkerech je vysoká, jelikož by mohly napomoci rychlejší, jednodušší a efektivnější charakterizaci pacientů a personalizovanému léčebnému postupu.V nedávné době byly popsány v patogenezi mnoha onemocnění epigenetické a regulační mechanizmy, zejména pak úloha krátkých nekódujících RNA ( mikroRNA). Tyto molekuly byly studovány jako potenciální biomarkery pro své jedinečné vlastnosti, jelikož jsou lehce detekovatelné ve tkáních i tělních tekutinách, jsou vysoce tkáňově i časově specifické a jejich hladiny jsou měřitelné zavedenými laboratorními technikami. Bylo prokázáno, že některé miRNA jsou asociované s ileální a kolonickou Crohnovou chorobou u dospělých pacientů, nebo jsou schopné odlišit pacienty s ulcerózní kolitidou od pacientů s Crohnovou chorobou, přesto ale jejich role a funkce jak u dospělých, tak u dětských pacientů s IBD  není stále dostatečně prozkoumána. Naše studie se zaměřuje na globální profilování miRNA u dětských pacientů s IBD a následné srovnávání expresních profilů u různých podskupin těchto pacientů, a to jak s odlišnou diagnózou (ulcerózní kolitida a Crohnova choroba), tak s různě závažným průběhem vlastního onemocnění,či odpovědí na léčbu. Cílem je vytvoření diagnostických, prognostických či prediktivních panelů miRNA, pomocí kterých by bylo možné včasně diagnostikovat pacienty s horší prognózou či léčebnou odpovědí, na druhé straně zbytečně nezatěžovat pacienty s prognosticky příznivější formou IBD nadbytečnou léčbou s množstvím potenciálních nežádoucích účinků. Se získanými poznatky by bylo možné zkvalitnění jak diagnostického,tak terapeutického postupu.",

Je charakterizován pomalým růstem se schopností metastazovat, a to zejména do plic. Nejhorší prognózu mají chondrosarkomy osového skeletu s vysokým stupněm malignity. Jelikož se jedná o chemorezistentní a radiorezistentní nádor, je úspěch léčby dán pouze radikalitou primárního operačního výkonu. Prognóza pacientů s inoperabilním nádorem je infaustní. Některé typy chrupavčitých nádorů obsahují mutace isocitrát dehydrogenáz a receptorů růstového faktoru odvozeného od trombocytů. Tyto mutace mohou souviset s dediferenciací chrupavčitých nádorů a tím i prognózou pacientů. Odlišení chondrosarkomu od chondroblastické varianty osteosarkomu je obtížné, ale zásadní pro léčebný postup. Pozitivní výsledek mutací isocitrát dehydrogenáz silně upřednostňuje diagnózu chondrosarkomu. Cílení na tyto metabolické cesty by mohlo být novou strategií v léčbě inoperabilních nebo metastatických chondrosarkomů.",

Úspěšné zhojení anastomózy je zcela zásadní pro pooperační průběh, v opačném případě vznikají závažné komplikace. Je proto nutné splnit během operace několik podmínek pro dobré hojení anastomózy. Stěžejním je výborné prokrvení napojovaných konců trávicí trubice. V současnosti je jedinou objektivní metodou stanovení prokrvení pomocí indocyaninové zeleně (ICG). Jde o vyšetření zobrazovací metodou, jež zachycuje blízké infračervené záření emitované fluorescenční látkou podanou intravenózně. Bezkontaktní termografie (IRT) je naproti tomu zobrazovací metodou neinvazivní, opakovatelnou, nevyžadující podání intravenózních barviv, které mohou vyvolat alergické reakce i pořizovací a provozní náklady jsou oproti ICG výrazně nižší. Předpokladem využitelnosti IRT v hodnocení prokrvení je zobrazení poklesu teploty málo prokrveného segmentu trávicí trubice a tedy nutnost odstranění této části z těla a tudíž nemožnost využití pro anastomózu.",

   "annotation": "Dekubity, jako chronické rány výrazně snižují kvalitu života pacienta, ale představují také významné finanční zatížení zdravotního systému. Ve zvýšené míře vyskytují zejména u plegických pacientů. Chirurgická léčba dekubitů je sice zdlouhavá, ale ve vysokém procentu vede ke zhojení tohoto typu chronické rány. Operačnímu uzávěru dekubitu předchází pečlivá nekrektomie (kompletní odstranění všech avitálních tkání z rány) s exstirpací pseudocysty dekubitu, která je prováděna chirurgicky. Nové technologie jako např. Versajet (nekrektomie pomocí vodní trysky) otevírají nové možnosti chirurgické přípravy rány před jejím operačním uzávěrem. U chronických ran dochází v procesu hojení k prodloužení zánětlivé fáze a hojení proto nepostupuje do další fáze. Jedním z mnoha faktorů uplatňujících se ve fázi zánětu jsou parametry oxidativního stresu - reaktivní formy kyslíku a dusíku. Cílem projektu je posoudit přínosy méně invazivního přístupu při nekrektomii s využitím Versajet, než při klasické chirurgické nekrektomii ve vztahu k dynamice reaktivních forem kyslíku, dusíku a markerů zánětu.",

Důvodem, proč jsme navrhli tuto klinickou studii, je nedostatek důkazů pro léčbu této významné skupiny pacientů (1 z 2500 dospělých). Jejich mortalita zůstává stále zhruba 20% i přes recentní pokroky v léčbě. Na základě aktuálně dostupné evidence není díky významnému snížení mortality moderní farmakoterapií srdečního selhání zcela jasné, kteří pacienti by měli mít implantován ICD. Naše hypotéza je, že pacienti se symptomatickým srdečním selháním s LVEF ?35%, bez významného rozsahu fibrózy myokardu na magnetické rezonanci, nebudou z implantace CRT-D profitovat více než pacienti z implantace CRT-P. Pokud se naše hypotéza potvrdí, tato klinická studie by mohla přinést důkazy pro management těchto pacientů s významným dopadem na běžnou praxi a náklady zdravotní péče.",

Progresivní expanze WNV v zemích Evropy v důsledku probíhajících klimatických změn významně zvyšuje riziko přenosu infekce WNV krevní transfuzí. V roce 2018 začala sezóna výskytu onemocnění západonilskou horečkou dříve, než v předchozích letech a byla charakterizována mnohem větším počtem případů. Během sezóny v roce 2018 došlo v ČR v regionu jižní Moravy k výskytu prvních pěti potvrzených autochtonních lidských případů onemocnění virem WNV, včetně jednoho úmrtí. V rámci zefektivnění postupů pro zajištění bezpečnosti transfuzních přípravků v ČR, s ohledem na riziko infekce západonilské horečky, je nutný především systematický sběr epidemiologických údajů o infekci WNV u dárců krve. Předkládaný projekt poskytne informaci o výskytu WNV RNA a o výskytu anti-WNV IgM a IgG protilátek u asymptomatických dárců krve regionu jižní Moravy. Výsledky projektu budou zásadním příspěvkem pro celostátní diskusi o zavedení povinného testování západonilské horečky u dárců krve v rizikových oblastech ČR.",

Tento typ degenerativního postižení je diagnostikován u stále většího počtu a současně se  toto postižení objevuje u mladších osob s vysokými nároky na zatížení pohybového aparátu a rychlý návrat k původní aktivitám a výkonosti.\nU středně pokročilých stádií gonartrózy máme k dispozici dvě léčebné metody formou chirurgického zákroku: valgizační osteotomie tibie a unikompartmentální endoprotetickou náhradu. Metody se od sebe liší již vlastní filozofií přístupu k postiženému kloubu. V případě valgizační osteotomie tibie (HTO, high tibial osteotomy) je principem změnit osu končetiny takovým způsobem, aby původně přetížená číst kolenního kloubu byla odlehčena a zátěž se přenesla na zevní stranu kolene. Druhou metodou je náhrada části kolenního kloubu unikompartmentální, částečnou endoprotézou (UKA, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty). \nNaplnění smyslu projektu bude provedeno prostřednictvím časosběrného (předoperačního a pooperačního) hodnocení změn kinematických a dynamických projevů chůze (3D kinematická analýza, síla v kloubech), rozložení plantárních tlaků na chodidlech (podobarografická plošina Emed) a hodnocení izokinetické svalové síly kolenního a kyčelního kloubu (izokinetická dynamometrie). Dále bude provedeno subjektivní hodnocení bolestivosti a samoobslužnosti (dotazník).\nObě operační metody jsou dlouhodobě a celosvětově používány se srovnatelnými výsledky Primárním cílem projektu je vzájemná komparace kinematických a dynamických projevů chůze u pacientů, kteří byli indikování k jednomu ze dvou výše popsaných chirurgických přístupů. Výsledkem naší práce bude přesná kvantifikace rozdílů v rychlosti návratu do plného zatížení a rychlost normalizace pohybových stereotypů, jejichž patologie jsou na degenerativní postižení váhonosných kloubů vždy vázány.\nPři kinematické analýze bude prováděno měření nejen v oblasti dolních končetin a pánve, ale bude sledován pohyb celé postavy. Analýza těchto dat bude mít za úkol odhalit přetížení zbylých segmentů pohybového aparátu. Tato analýza již překračuje vlastní práci porovnání 2 operačních metod a může být základem pro další studium normalizace pohybových stereotypů.",

Interakce mezi stromatem a epitelem regulují vývoj mléčné žlázy a jejich deregulace vede k poruchám vývoje a ke vzniku rakoviny prsu. V naší předchozí studii jsme ukázali, že fibroblasty mléčné žlázy jsou důležitými regulátory vývoje epitelu mléčné žlázy. V probíhající studii jsme se zaměřili na objasnění mechanismů, kterými fibroblasty regulují vývoj epitelu, a na roli signalizace fibroblastového růstového faktoru (FGF), která dosud nebyla ve fibroblastech stromatu mléčné žlázy prozkoumána. Naše výsledky, získané především z in vitro experimentů v pokročilých 3D kokulturách v kombinaci se zobrazovacími technikami, molekulárně-biologickými a histologickými metodami, ukázali, že fibroblasty a FGF signalizace ve fibroblastech regulují morfogenezi epitelu mléčné žlázy prostřednictvím tvorby a remodelace ECM, parakrinní signalizace a mechanického působení.

Intestinal cell kinase (ICK kináza) je citlivým regulátorem tvorby cilia a je v této své funkci evolučně konzervována. Mutace v ICK jsou spojovány s letálními lidskými vývojovými patologiemi; popsána byla i role ICK v regulaci homeostázy. Molekulární mechanismy, kterými ICK reguluje cilium, však nejsou známy a jejich identifikace je hlavním cílem předkládaného návrhu. Na základě našich předběžných dat předpokládáme, že ICK reguluje cilium fosforylací proteinů, které jsou součástí proteinových komplexů důležitých pro tvorbu cilia a regulaci intraflagelárního transportu. Pomocí biochemických metod a buněčných experimentů nejprve identifikujeme proteinové motivy fosforylované kinázou ICK v buňkách, a následně popíšeme úlohu těchto fosforylací v regulaci cilia. Tímto způsobem nejen popíšeme nové mechanismy regulace cilia, ale také potenciálně přispějeme k rozvoji léčby chorob způsobených deregulací ICK aktivity.",

Navzdory současnému vědeckému a terapeutickému pokroku nedošlo v posledních dvou desetiletích k významnému zlepšení v přežívání HNSCC pacientů. Nedávné studie naznačují, že progresi HNSCC mohou podporovat fibroblasty asociované s nádorem (CAFs). Komunikace mezi CAFs a nádorovými buňkami se zdá být klíčovým faktorem pro trvalý růst nádoru. CAFs mohou být manipulovány nádorovými buňkami směrem k autofagii a aerobní glykolýze. V takových podmínkách mohou CAFs podporovat progresi HNSCC produkcí faktorů, jako je CCL-5, HMGB1, IL6 a IL8. Při exportu těchto faktorů může být zapojena sekreční autofagie. V tomto projektu chceme zkoumat úlohu sekreční autofagie u CAFs odvozených z HNSCC pacientů a vliv HNSCC kondicionovaných médií (odvozené z nádorových buněk s a bez inhibice autofagie) na metabolismus těchto CAFs.",

   "annotation": "Jedním z největších problémů při produkci pluripotentních kmenových buněk (hPSC) pro aplikace v regenerativní medicíně je jejich adaptace, provázená destabilizací genomu a funkčním selháním. K ochraně genomové stability mají hPSC zvýšenou aktivitu bázově excizního opravného mechanizmu (BER) a homologní rekombinace (HR), zatímco aktivity nehomologního a alternativního spojování konců DNA jsou konstantní. Náš výzkum ukázal, že oxidativní poškození bází je konvertováno na dvojřetězcové zlomy aktivitou BER a následně bezchybně opraveno rychlým spojováním konců, zatímco pluripotenční geny spolupracují na ochraně konců DNA před resekcí. Naší hypotézou je, že zlomy asociované s replikačním stresem u adaptovných buněk, se málo aktivním BER, jsou opravovány stejným opravným mechanimem spojování konců. Oprava je tak spojena s chybami, které urychlují proces adaptace. Cílem projektu je ověřit tuto hypotézu a ukázat, že změna volby dráhy z MMEJ na HR za pomocí cemických látek může vést u buněk zatížených replikačním stresem",

Nejefektivnější léčbou pro tyto farmakorezistentní pacienty je resekční operace, jejíž základní podmínkou je přesné vytyčení epileptogenní zóny (EZ). EZ můžeme vymezit pomocí invazivní EEG monitorace (IEEG). V rámci IEEG hodnotíme široké rozpětí frekvencí, včetně vysokofrekvenčních oscilací (HFO; 80-500 Hz). V nedávné době jsme zjistili, že u pacientů s epilepsií existují i velmi vysoké vysokofrekvenční oscilace (VHFO, 500 Hz až 2 kHz).  Zdá se, že VHFO lépe korelují s rozsahem EZ než standardní HFO. Použití jak standardních makroelektrod, tak i inovativních mikroelektrod nám umožní detailně studovat charakteristiky VHFO, konkrétně frekvenci, vztah k patologii, k chirurgickým výsledků, 3 D distribuci v rámci EZ, vzorce propagace.

Změny struktury a/nebo funkce TATS mohou být důsledkem i příčinou srdeční patologie, např. srdečního selhání. Dostupné metodické přístupy pro analýzu funkčních charakteristik TATS poskytují rozdílné výsledky. Proto jsme nedávno navrhli novou metodu ponechávající buňku intaktní a umožňující přesnější odhad vlastností TATS. Tato metoda je založena na výrazném zvýšení elektrického odporu TATS díky expozici měřené buňky izotonickému roztoku s nízkou vodivostí. V rámci tohoto projektu získáme prostřednictvím naší nově vyvinuté metody nové a přesnější informace o funkčních charakteristikách TATS u srdečních buněk potkana a člověka. Lidské buňky budou izolovány ze srdcí postižených srdečním selháním a rovněž ze zdravé srdeční tkáně získané během chirurgických výkonů. Experimentální data budou využita ke zpřesnění popisu TATS v matematických modelech srdečních buněk s cílem přesněji simulovat a hlouběji pochopit vliv TATS na elektromechanickou aktivitu srdečních buněk.",

Therefore, this project will be focused on determination of the binding partner of CBS from the group of cytoskeletal proteins in various cancer cells. We will evaluate a role of this protein complex in apoptosis induction, migration and proliferation. Further, we will estimate an involvement of this complex in the effect of microtubule targeting chemotherapeutics.",

Dalším důležitým faktorem je nedávný objev kauzální terapie tzv. korektorů a potenciátorů. Kauzální  terapie  je  schopná  obnovit  funkci  chloridového  kanálu,  čímž  se  zmenší  projevy onemocnění a sníží koncentrace soli v potu.

Stávající námi prováděné analýzy nádorové tkáně zahrnují nyní transkripční profilování, sekvenování nové generace , NGS Agilent (whole exome/genome sequencing); a detekci fosforylace receptorových kináz a MAP kináz proteomickými metodami. V roce 2017 jsme zavedli do komplexního vyšetřovacího panelu detekci specifických translokaci/genových fúzí + hodnocení celého transkriptomu pomocí (RNAseq). Námi navrhovaný komplexní rozvoj vyšetřování nádorové tkáně u dětí s refrakterními a relabujícími solidními nádory a NHL rozšířeným panelem vyšetření (histopatologie, genomické, transkriptomické fosfoproteomické vyšetření, vyšetření mutační nálože a nádorového mikroprostředí ) spolu s bioinformatickou podporou, vedou k prohloubení našich znalostí o molekulárním profilu nádoru na genetickém pozadí hostitele (nosičství germinálních mutací). Na základě dosavadních analýz bylo možno aplikovat personalizovanou léčbu na základě doporučení expertního panelu (molecular tumor board) u přibližně 60 % z ročně vyšetřených cca 90-ti pacientů. V následujícím roce plánujeme ke stávajícímu panelu vyšetření zavést proteomické vyšetřování likvoru u vybraných pacientů. Na základě dosavadních zkušeností s léčbou nasazovanou dle výsledků výše uvedených vyšetření očekáváme, že prohloubením tohoto inovativního přístupu a jeho aplikací v klinické praxi dosáhneme dalšího zlepšení léčebných odpovědí u významného procenta dětí s refrakterními malignitami. S ohledem na genetickou variabilitu tumoru při jeho recidivě/progresi klademe důraz na opakované biopsie a vyšetřování nádorové tkáně souborem výše uvedených analýz, čímž sledujeme nejmodernější trendy v onkologii a směřujeme k postupům tzv. „liquid dynamic medicine“ a „N-of-1 clinical trials“.",

Jejich časný průkaz však může vést k uchránění pacientů nadbytečnému vyšetřování zatěžujícími paraklinickými metodami, časnému genetickému poradenství a v některých případech i nastavení individualizované terapie. Trendem v pediatrické epileptologii je proto časné využití moderních molekulárně genetických metod (zejm. sekvenování nové generace; NGS), a to v diagnostice především těch syndromů, u kterých existuje individualizovaná terapie s významným dopadem na další klinický průběh. Aktuálně používané NGS panely čítají řádově stovky genů – to, spolu s významnou fenotypovou variabilitou jednotlivých epileptických syndromů, mnohdy vede k problematické interpretaci nálezů. Její rutinní součástí je komparace nalezených sekvenčních variant s dostupnými predikčními programy, které ale nezohledňují individuální fenotyp pacienta. Cílem projektu je proto srovnání závěrů predikčních programů se závěry fenotypově-genotypové korelace lékaře, a tím stanovit výtěžnost NGS panelu používaného na našem pracovišti.",

   "annotation": "V posledních desetiletích zaznamenaly moderní diagnostické postupy a intervence navigované zobrazovacími metodami zásadní pokrok při léčbě onkologických pacientů. Zdokonalením prošly nejen diagnostické zobrazovací metody, ale paralelně s nimi i techniky invazivní endovaskulární či intratumorální léčby. Pokrok v diagnostice umožňuje vyhledávání zhoubného onemocnění v jeho časných stadiích, umožňuje podrobněji charakterizovat nemocnou tkáň pacienta, získáváme informace o individuálních vlastnostech konkrétní léze. Integrace nálezů těchto nových diagnostických metod do terapeutického plánu pacienta umožňuje individualizaci postupů v moderní onkologické léčbě. Miniinvazivní radiologicko-onkologické intervence využívají zobrazovací metody nejen při zákroku, ale jako první z terapeutických metod mohou využít spektrum pokročilých zobrazovacích metod ke sledování léčebné odpovědi. Cílem projektu je analýza přínosu specifických diagnostických a terapeutických postupů využívaných v Komplexním onkologickém centru Masarykova onkologického ústavu v Brně ve spolupráci s Fakultní nemocnicí Brno a Fakultní nemocnicí U Svaté Anny ve srovnání s celorepublikovými daty. Výzkum bude zaměřen na modalitu PET/MR, pokročilé volumetrické analýzy, korelace radiologických a molekulárních markerů (miRNA). Výsledky léčby u vybraných diagnóz primárních nádorů jater (hepatocelulární karcinom, cholangiocelulární karcinom) a sekundárních nádorů jater (zejména metastázy kolorektálního karcinomu), u kterých byly využity radiologické intervenční přístupy budou kriticky zhodnoceny ve srovnání s daty z jiných komplexních onkologických center, kde pokročilé metody nebyly dostupné. Projekt přímo navazuje na projekt specifického výzkumu řešeného v roce 2018 na naší klinice v rámci projektů Lékařské fakulty Masarykovy univerzity, kterého výsledky nebylo možné v rámci 12 měsíců vyhodnotit vzhledem k technické náročnosti provedení celorepublikových statistik z let 2005-2015.",

Cílem projektu je zjistit, zda genetické mutace kandidátních genů pro hereditární arytmické syndromy jsou přítomny u pacientů s prodělanou srdeční zástavou. První kohorta pacientů jsou náhle zemřelí pacienti z let 2008 až 2016, u kterých byl zjištěn negativní patologicko-anatomický korelát smrti. Druhou skupinu pacientů tvoří pacienti s prodělanou srdeční zástavou na podkladě maligní arytmie, kteří byli vyšetřeni na IKK v letech 2012 až 2017 a u kterých se nepodařila stanovit dosavadními postupy etiologie a  je u nich tudíž předpoklad vrozené kanálopatie. U části těchto pacientů již genetická analýza byla provedena. S postupem času se však změnily možnosti a dostupnost genetického vyšetření, přičemž v současné době se na OLG vyšetřuje podstatně širší panel genů (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, AKAP9, CACNA1C, CALM1, CALM2, CAV3, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ5, SCN4B, SNTA1, CPVT, RYR2, CASQ2). Projekt je zaměřen na homogenizaci a finalizaci genetického vyšetření těchto kohort pacientů. Výstupem projektu bude zjištění etiologie náhlé smrti u pacientů v našem regionu a zpřesnění údajů o výtěžnosti genetického vyšetření u pacientů s prodělanou srdeční zástavou. Projekt má vysoký potenciál publikovatelnosti dosažených výsledků.",

Detekce světla vyzářeného je podstatou využití těchto látek v experimentech. Navíc světlo emitované fluorescenční látkou je viditelné jenom při použití speciální kamery, takže neobarvuje tkáně a neztrácí se tak přehlednost operačního pole. Viditelnost tkání obarvených pomocí ICG závisí na místě podání. Intravenózní podání zajistí distribuci do všech vitálních tkání, kam proudí krev. ICG se při aplikaci do tukové tkáně síří tukovými a lymfatickými cestami do okolí. Vzhledem k embryologickému původu perirektální tukové tkáně je tato tkáň od okolních struktur ostře ohraničena a nedochází k distribuci ICG mimo tuto tkáň. ICG je taktéž po podání intravenózně vylučováno játry do žluče a tudíž zviditelní žlučový strom. Bude tedy snaha o zviditelnění struktur konečníku a žlučových cest k jejich bezpečné identifikaci v průběhu operace. Chirurgická klinika ICG používá v rutinně v detekci prokrvení střeva a plic.",

   "annotation": "Glioblastom představuje nejagresivnější gliální nádor s progresivním chováním a velmi nepříznivou prognózou. Hlavní překážka v efektivní léčbě glioblastomu je jeho invazivní růst do peritumorózní mozkové tkáně limitující efekt resekce a jeho intratumorózní biologická heterogenita oslabující léčebný efekt terapie onkologické. Reziduální onemocnění v peritumorózní mozkové zóně je léčeno onkologicky na základě analýzy tkáně masy tumoru, která byla odstraněna při operaci. S ohledem na vysokou intratumorózní heterogenitu si ovšem nemůžeme být jisti, že charakteristika reziduálního onemocnění je stejná, jaká byla popsána ve tkáni získané operací. Tento fakt může zodpovídat za selhání dosavadních snah o cílenou biologickou léčbu u GBM. V první fázi našeho projektu jsme odebrané vzorky topizovaně zpracovali a určili významné histopatologické vlastnosti (celularita, proliferační index, vaskulární denzita) a expresi EGFR. Tyto vlastnosti byly selektivně hodnoceny v tumorózní, peritumorózní a zdravé tkáni, subklasifikované dle exprese proteinu nestin. První výsledky prezentované v “Pilotní studie: selektivní biopsie u high grade gliálních neoplázií mozku“ podporují naši hypotézu o intratumorózní heterogenitě. Našim dalším cílem navazující na předchozí výzkum je analýza exprese markerů, které mohou být využity jako potencionální cíle adjuvantní terapie u pacientů s glioblastomem. \nCílem projektu je studium a popis heterogenity významných histopatologických biomarkerů na resekční hranici glioblastomu, tedy na hranici tumor – peritumorózní oblast nádorové infiltrace, na kterou je cílená adjuvantní onkologická léčba. Lepší pochopení reziduálního onemocnění v peritumorózní mozkové zóně je kritické pro odhalení mechanizmů zodpovědných za recidivu glioblastomu s cílem optimalizoval chirurgickou resekci a vyvinout nové terapeutické postupy.",

V preklinické oblasti je pracoviště dlouhodobě zaměřeno na studium psychotropních látek. Klinické hodnocení léčiv se potom zaměřuje na akademické klinické studie, zejména s vlastními vyvíjenými léčivy, které spadají mezi tzv. léčivé přípravky pro moderní terapie. Jedna část výzkumu ústavu je zaměřena přímo na vývoj a výrobu těchto léčiv, zatímco druhá část týmu následně po aplikaci pacientům v rámci klinického hodnocení hodnotí jejich bezpečnost a terapeutický přínos.\nFarmakokinetická část je zaměřena na výzkum nových přírodních látek s potenciálním terapeutickým využitím. Konkrétně se farmakokinetické studie zaměřují na interakce sledovaných látek s enzymatickým systémem cytochromu P450 (CYP). Další oblastí výzkumu je studium zapojení endokanabinoidního systému do regulace aktivity CYP. V neposlední řadě je farmakokinetická laboratoř místem vývoje nových analytických metod, které se dají využít pro klinický výzkum nebo pro vývoj nových lékových forem s prodlouženým uvolňováním léčiva.\nBehaviorální část je zaměřena na několik souběžných výzkumných směrů. Jedná se především o preklinické modelování látkových závislostí a jejich farmakologické ovlivnění. Do skupiny studovaných léčiv patří ligandy glutamátergních receptorů jako je experimentální látka NBQX. Další studie se zaměřují na nežádoucí metabolické účinky antipsychotik a jejich izolaci od metabolických vlivů schizofrenii podobného fenotypu. Kromě toho se zaměřujeme i na vývoj neurozobrazovacích biomarkerů účinků psychofarmak a animálních modelů neuropsychiatrických onemocnění.\nOnkologická část je zaměřena na výzkum a vývoj protinádorové terapeutické vakcíny na bázi autologních aktivovaných dendritických buněk. Tato terapeutická vakcína byla vyvinuta v rámci jednotky ACIU (Advanced Cell Immunotherapy Unit). Během vývoje dendritické vakcíny i vlastní realizace klinického hodnocení fáze I/II jsou výzkumně hodnoceny imunologické vlastnosti léčiva, na základě průběžného imunomonitoringu pacientů. Výzkumné činnosti jsou dále směrovány k personalizaci vhodného výběru pacientů, kdy se jeví, že řada souběžně požívaných protinádorových léčiv zejména z rodiny multikinázových inhibitorů (TKi) negativně inhibuje imunitní odpověď pacienta a je do terapeutických kombinací s dendritickou vakcínou nevhodná.",

Značení se provádí instilací  1-2ml speciálně připraveného roztoku modrého barviva ve směsi s kontrastní látkou. Zavedení jehly a vlastní aplikace roztoku je provedena radiologem pod navigovanou CT kontrolou v lokální anestezii za aseptických kautel. Následně je pacient převezen v doprovodu operatéra na operační sál, kde je provedena videotorakoskopická operace s klínovitým vytnutím označeného plicního parenchymu s potencionálním ložiskem. Vzorek je následně odeslán k histologickému zpracování.  \nPoužitím tohoto postupu předpokládáme zkrácení doby hospitalizace, snížení množství analgetické terapie, zvýšení komfortu pro pacienta a v některých případech urychlení stanovení diagnózy.

   "annotation": "Předložený projekt je složen ze dvou výzkumných záměrů: „Elektrofyziologické koreláty fyziologického déjà vu fenoménu“ (Projekt A) a „Zraková pozornost a paměťové funkce u pacientů s Alzheimerovou nemocí“ (Projekt B).\n\nProjekt A:\nDéjà vu je anomální paměťový fenomén, při kterém dochází k neadekvátnímu pocitu familiarity nově zažívané situace. Vyskytuje se u většiny zdravé populace, ale i jako doprovodný jev meziotemporální epilepsie a schizofrenie. V těchto onemocněních dominují změny excitability mozkové kůry (KE) a strukturní změny v oblasti hipokampu. Podobný vzorec strukturních a metabolomických změn v temporálních lalocích byl v našich předešlých studiích identifikován i u zdravých jedinců zažívajících déjà vu. Předkládaný projekt má za úkol rozšířit poznatky o roli KE v genezi déjà vu u zdravých jedinců přímým měřením elektrofyziologické aktivity kortexu prostřednictvím EEG a simultánního TMS-EEG (transkraniální evokované potenciály) v reakci na vizuální stimulaci (Pattern glare task, který nově uvádíme do českého prostředí). Získané poznatky povedou k lepšímu pochopení excitační rovnováhy a její roli v paměťových anomáliích u zdravých jedinců i pacientů s některými neurologickými onemocněními.  \n\nProjekt B:\nAlzheimerova nemoc (AN) je nejčastější příčina demence ve stárnoucí populaci, její incidence vzrůstá s věkem a ve věku nad 85 let trpí AN téměř polovina populace. Onemocnění je charakterizováno poruchou krátkodobé epizodické paměti, ale již v časném stádiu onemocnění, tj. mírné kognitivní poruchy (MPK-AN) dochází rovněž k poruše zrakové pozornosti a zrakově-prostorových funkcí. Demence při AN má negativní dopad na soběstačnost pacienta, sociální a pracovní zařazení, kvalitu života pacienta i pečovatele a je spojena s významným zvýšením morbidity/mortality. V projektu budeme zkoumat neurální koreláty paměťových poruch hodnocených testem asociačního učení u pacientů s MKP-AN. Multimodální zobrazování mozku pomocí magnetické rezonance (MRI) v kombinaci s neinvazivní mozkovou stimulací (NIMS), jakou je repetitivní transkraniální magnetická stimulace (rTMS), slouží jako další nástroj pro odhalení patofyziologických mechanismů kognitivních a behaviorálních symptomů. Navíc pomocí NIMS můžeme navodit změny plasticity a funkce mozku, které mohou dále vést k potenciálně léčebným účinkům na kognitivní funkce.",

Projekty v předchozích obdobích byly zaměřeny na tvorbu a implementaci klinického doporučeného postupu v péči o osoby s nehojící se ránou. Proveden byl jednak rozsáhlý průzkum zaměřený na proces hodnocení nehojících se ran v klinické praxi (u poskytovatelů akutní lůžkové péče, domácí péče a pracovišť sociálních služeb). Následně byly hodnoceny příčiny vzniku sororigenních ran a psychometrické vlastnosti škál pro hodnocení rizika vzniku tlakových lézí. Z předchozích projektů vyplynuly nedostatky nejen v hodnocení nehojících se ran, ale zejména v nedostatečné erudici NLZP v přímé péči v managementu ran a v identifikaci rizika vzniku dekubitů. V rámci projektů SV byla posuzována kvalita péče o osoby s dekubity, ale nebyla věnována dostatečná pozornost také dalším ranám mimo tlakové (pergamenová kůže, inkontinenční dermatitida) a také nákladovosti jejich prevence a péče. V navrhovaném projektu se jedná o multicentrickou observačně deskriptivní studii s prvky intervenční studie zaměřenou na validaci a klinické využití nových objektivizujících škál pro hodnocení ran (GLOBIAD a ISTAP). Projektové aktivity navazují na odbornou činnost garanta projektu (členka výboru České společnosti pro léčbu ran - ČSLR, výboru European Wound Management Association – EWMA, výboru Evropského poradního panelu pro otázky dekubitů - EPUAP). Cíle projektu zahrnují zvýšení odborných kompetencí všeobecných sester v managementu ran v intenzivní péči. Projekt je koncipován jako multidimenzionální, s propojením specifických oblastí péče o rány – prevenci a diferenciální diagnostiku ran v intenzivní péči souvisejících s neposkytnutou, či nerealizovanou péčí. Na základě projektových aktivit bude možné získat relevantní data, provést klinické a populační (epidemiologické) zhodnocení u konkrétního poskytovatele péče, plánovat a realizovat edukační aktivity pro zdravotníky v přímé péči a zvýšit jejich znalosti a dovednosti.",

Současně je nutno brát zřetel na narůstající počet nemocných s poruchou paměti a rizikem chyb v užívání medikace. Časná diagnostika poruch paměti toto riziko významně sníží. Nově se objevující druhy léčiv s sebou sice přinášejí naději na úspěšnější řešení různých chorobných stavů, klinická zkoušení léků však často pacienty vyššího věku multimorbidní a se sníženou soběstačnosti nezahrnují. Proto je důležité věnovat pozornost případným novým komplikacím spojeným se zavedením nového léčiva - v poslední době konkrétně skupiny nových orálních antikoagulancií. Nadále bude věnována pozornost preventivním aktivitám podporujícím úspěšné stárnutí a předcházejícím ztrátě soběstačnosti seniorů. U hospitalizovaných nemocných bude věnována pozornost rychlosti návratu míry soběstačnosti seniora v závislosti na intenzitě rehabilitace. Projekt je i v nadcházejícím roce věnován různým směrům dlouhodobé prevence multimorbidity jako faktoru významně urychlujícího vznik závislosti seniora a zhoršení kvality jeho života. Jedním z komplexně působících faktorů je vitamin D, jehož nízká hladina má vliv mimo jiné i senzitivitu tkání k inzulinu, a tedy stav kompenzace diabetu včetně rozvoje chronických komplikací diabetu. \nVýznamná je i důsledná příprava starších nemocných k operačnímu výkonu i včetně zjištění jeho kognitivního výkonu",

Minorita nemocných indikovaných k resekčnímu výkonu podstupuje náročný operační výkon s významným rizikem perioperačních komplikací. Přestože je resekce považována za jedinou potenciálně kurativní metodu, není přínos chirurgické intervence u všech pacientů stejný. Jedním z možných vysvětlení horší prognózy některých z nich je uvažována diseminace nádoru - přítomnost mikrometastáz, které jsou pod rozlišovací schopností zobrazovacích metod a nejsou patrné ani makroskopicky při operaci. Vzhledem k současnému širokému užití Indocyaninové zeleně (ICG) se nabízí možnost užití tohoto fluoroforu k zobrazení pouhým okem neparných metastáz nádoru na površích orgánů dutiny břišní a na pobřišnici. V projektu bude využito skutečnosti, že karcinom pankreatu produkuje specifický protein (CA 19-9), který exprimuje na svém povrchu a rovněž uvolňuje do krevního oběhu. Jedná se o nádorový marker standardně využívaný v klinické praxi. Projekt bude probíhat ve třech na sebe navazujících fázích: 1. Konjugace ICG s vhodnou protilátkou proti CA 19-9. 2. Testování výsledného komplexu ICG + protilátka na buněčných liniích karcinomu pankreatu ex vivo, 3. Hodnocení diagnostického potenciálu tohoto komplexu in vivo na modelu imunodeficientních myší s inokulovaným karcinomem pankreatu. Jedná se o preklinický výzkum s účastí Ústavu RECETOX Přírodovědecké fakulty MU, Ústavu biochemie MU CEITEC MU, Ústavu Patologické Fyziologie Lékařské Fakulty MU Brno a Chirurgické kliniky Lékařské Fakulty MU FN Brno. Cílem projektu je preklinický výzkum karcinomu pankreatu. Očekávaným výstupem bude vytvoření komplexu ICG/protilátka vhodného k zobrazení tohoto nádoru.

Návrh navazuje na projekt MUNI/A/0925/2017 Poruchy tvorby protilátek a komplementového systému. Je zaměřen především na primární a sekundární poruchy tvorby  protilátek a dysregulaci v komplementovém systému – jmenovitě u deficitu C1-INH – hereditárního angioedému (HAE). \nV oblasti HAE bude ukončeno sledování významu a rozsahu aktivace granulocytů v klidovém období i v době ataky, sledování supresivního efektu aktivovaných granulocytů u této choroby. (Dr. R. Hakl, Mgr. Peter Slanina, Mgr Julie Štíchová). V molekulárně-proteinové části plánujeme rozšířit testování hypotézy o autoregulaci exprese C1 inhibitoru z komerčně dostupných buněčných linií na monocyty získaných od zdravých dárců (Mgr. T. Kováčová). Dále se budeme zabývat sledováním sekvenčních změn na úrovni DNA převážně v nekódujících oblastech nejen v genu SERPING1 (je zodpovědný za HAE), ale plánujeme zvýšit počet modelových genů, na nichž budeme testovat vliv intronových mutací na sestřih pre-mRNA (Mgr. P. Hujová).\nDále budou sledovány některé klinické a laboratorní aspekty sekundárního imunodeficitu, který se vyvíjí u dětských pacientů po léčbě rituximabem (Dr. E. Hlaváčková). Z hlediska patogeneze  imunodeficitu u primární hypogamaglobulinémie - běžného variabilního imunodeficitu ( CVID) jsou plánovány pokusy týkající se TNF receptoru typu II  na produkci imunoglobulinů  (Mgr. Peter Slanina, Mgr. Julie Štíchová) Navážeme též na dosud provedené analýzy dat získaných NGS a pokusíme se charakterizovat složení střevního mikrobiomu u dvou kohort pacientů: i) nemocní s agamoglobulinémií typu běžného variabilního imunodeficitu (CVID) a ii) imunokompromitovaní pacienti po transplantaci solidního orgánu (Mgr. Kristýna Fiedorová).  \nDále budeme pokračovat v analýze méně diverzních polymikrobiálních vzorků a chceme se zaměřit také na genetické faktory virulence jinak komenzálních kmenů koaguláza-negativních stafylokoků způsobující závažné infekce u imunokompromitovaných pacientů (Mgr. Iva Kotásková).\nJako formu výstupů předpokládáme především prezentaci na konferencích, ale též přípravu publikací. Dr Hakl by měl předložit svou doktorskou dizertační práci.",

Velkým příslibem je zavádění tzv. personalizované medicíny, která umožňuje pacientovi upravit léčbu podle jeho potřeb včetně snížení nežádoucích účinků na minimum, přičemž komplexně posuzuje různé faktory ovlivňující působení dané terapie. \nSoučástí léčby bývají velmi často infekční komplikace – řadí se dokonce k častější příčině úmrtí než choroba samotná. Aby tedy nedošlo k bezprostřednímu ohrožení života nemocného, je nevyhnutelné včas a správně rozpoznat původce infekce a začít s vhodnou a účinnou léčbou.\nCílem grantového projektu je přispět k detailnějšímu poznání biologie a patogeneze hematologických malignit a výsledky klinického i laboratorního výzkumu pomoci ke zkvalitnění života onkologických pacientů.",

Významnými profesemi jsou tzv. pomáhající profese, které směřují k podpoře rozvoje osobnosti člověka (jeho vzdělanosti, zdraví, psychické i fyzické kondici). Vysoká míra odbornosti profesního výkonu je zajišťována mj. díky provázanosti profesí s disciplínami pěstovanými na univerzitách – spojnicí je přitom přípravné (pregraduální) a další (celoživotní) vzdělávání profesionálů. V dynamice měnících se podmínek pro výkon profesí se proměňuje také jejich (sebe)pojímaní, rozsah působnosti, obsah i struktura činností. Profese se nacházejí v tranzici – procházejí změnami způsobenými globálními trendy, resortními politikami a dalšími vnějšími i vnitřními vlivy. Cílem projektu je zjistit, jakými tranzicemi v ČR v současnosti pomáhající profese procházejí, a vyhodnotit případné důsledky pro související studijní obory a akademické disciplíny na Masarykově univerzitě, resp. na univerzitách obecně (popř. v rovině resortních politik uplatňovaných vůči profesím). Výzkumem má být zachyceno, co se aktuálně mění v pojetí, rozsahu, obsahu a výkonu zkoumaných profesí při tranzicích. V první fázi (2019) bude realizováno expertní šetření založené na hloubkových interview s představiteli profesí (praktikujícími profesionály, zástupci profesních komunit a vzdělavateli profesionálů). Následně (2020) bude uskutečněno šíře založené dotazníkové šetření mezi profesionály a jejich vzdělavateli, v němž budou sledovány přechody a problémy typické pro jednotlivé profese a důsledky tranzicí pro vzdělávání profesionálů. Ve třetí fázi (2021) bude řešen problém interprofesionality a interdisciplinarity – prostřednictvím případových studií budou zkoumány profese operující na pomezí disciplín a profesních polí (předpokládá se zdokumentování některých nově se ustavujících interprofesí). V prodloužení poznávacího cíle výzkumu je ambicí řešitelů vyvozovat z poznatků návrhy na koncepční, obsahové, metodologické, popř. další úpravy přípravného a dalšího vzdělávání profesionálů na univerzitách. Projekt umožní na MU etablovat odbornou platformu, na níž bude možné se s oporou o výzkumná data konfrontovat s aktuálními problémy (studijní neúspěšnost, fluktuace a odchody (drop-out) z profese, oslabení zájmu o další vzdělávání apod.",

   "annotation": "Dětská onkologie dosáhla v posledních třiceti letech dramatických výsledků s poklesem mortality onkologicky nemocných dětí o více než 50%. Stále však existuje 15-20% dětí, u kterých se nepříznivý průběh jejich nemoci nedaří zvrátit. Pro tyto pacienty je nutné hledat nové, individualizované strategie léčby. Nezbytnou podmínkou pro tento koncept tzv. precizní medicíny je detailní molekulárněbiologická charakterizace tumoru. Kromě změn v kódujících oblastech DNA (nádorovém exomu) existují další molekulární změny přispívající k rozvoji nádorového onemocnění. Mezi ně patří epigenetické procesy, jako je metylace DNA, či genové strukturální přestavby, které vedou ke vzniku fúzních genů. Řada těchto metylačních změn a fúzních genů silně ovlivňuje chování nádoru a je možné je cílit dostupnými léčivy nebo jsou důležitými prognostickými faktory. Obecným cílem projektu je ověřit, zda analýza globálních metylačních profilů a fúzních genů představuje přínos pro terapeutické plánování u dětských pacientů s vysoce rizikovými solidními nádory, u nichž je známá sekvence nádorového exomu.",

Inhibice BCR-ABL pomocí inhibitorů tyrozinových kináz (TKI) představuje standard v léčbě CML a většina pacientů odpovídá na podání TKI pozitivně. TKI však často nevede k eradikaci choroby a to z důvodu nově získaných mutací BCR-ABL, způsobujících rezistenci k TKI. Nový alosterický inhibitor ABL001 umožňuje dvojí inhibici BCR-ABL a tím překonání rezistence vůči TKI. Rané výstupy klinických studií ukazují silnou a trvalou odpověď u pacientů s TKI-rezistentní CML na ABL001, ale také jeho toxicitu, jenž může být překážkou budoucích terapií. Molekulární mechanismy těchto vedlejších účinků nejsou známy a jsou předmětem tohoto návrhu. Hlavním cílem projektu je charakterizace aktivity ABL001 vůči všem známým lidským tyrosin kinázám in vitro a in vivo za účelem identifikace jeho dalších cílů.

Je třeba porovnat zdravé jedince a pacienty s již diagnostikovaným kardiovaskulárním onemocněním, zjistit, zda existuje závislost na pohlaví sledovaných osob.\nParametr CAVI je neinvazivní screeningový nástroj pro detekci časných změn tepenné tuhosti nezávislý na krevním tlaku v době měření (Fukuda Denshi Vasera VS – 1500N). Pro tento projekt je unikátní kombinace dvou neinvazivních metod standardně používaných pro screening osob s různě pokročilým procesem kardiovaskulárních abnormalit - sedmidenní ambulantní monitorování krevního tlaku a vyhodnocení stavu arterií, založené na měření kardiovaskulárního indexu CAVI. Patologické změny by byly diagnostikovány již v raném stádiu, což by umožnilo prevenci, včasnou intervenci a motivaci ke změně životního stylu.",

Předpokládaným patologickým mechanismem AEA je zánět zprostředkovaný Th2 lymfocyty a mimo jiné také snížená funkce indukovaných T-regulačních buněk (iTreg) produkujících IL-10 a zvýšené koncentraci gelatinázy B (MMP9) v séru. iTreg vznikají při aktivaci CD4+ T lymfocytů, která je ovlivňována také intracelulárním komplementem. Farmakologicky je možné další ovlivnění této aktivace vitamínem D. Projekt je zaměřen na sledování receptorů CD46, dále C3aR, C5aR u iTreg, jejich ovlivnění prostřednictvím vitamínu D in vitro u nemocných s AEA. Pomocí kultivačních pokusů bude sledována také produkce IL-10 iTreg získaných stimulací anti-CD3 + anti-CD46, dále bude sledována produkce MMP9 v supernatantech stimulovaných buněk. Zvýšená koncentrace MMP9 snižuje expresi CD46 a tím i aktivitu iTreg spolu s produkcí IL-10. Vitamín D naopak produkci IL-10 zvyšuje a obnovuje funkce iTreg, což by mohlo vést u pacientů s AEA ke zmírnění reaktivity imunitního systému.",

Jelikož se jedná o chemorezistentní a radiorezistentní nádor, je úspěch léčby dán pouze radikalitou primárního operačního výkonu. Prognóza pacientů s inoperabilním nádorem je infaustní. Některé typy chrupavčitých nádorů obsahují mutace isocitrát dehydrogenáz a receptorů růstového faktoru odvozeného od trombocytů. Tyto mutace mohou souviset s dediferenciací chrupavčitých nádorů a tím i prognózou pacientů. Odlišení chondrosarkomu od chondroblastické varianty osteosarkomu je obtížné, ale zásadní pro léčebný postup. Pozitivní výsledek mutací isocitrát dehydrogenáz silně upřednostňuje diagnózu chondrosarkomu.

Hraniční porucha osobnosti se jeví jako vhodná právě pro aplikace rTMS, protože jedním z klíčových neurálních mechanismů poruchy je narušená konektivita mezi limbickým systémem a prefrontálním kortexem, který je dobře dosažitelný pomocí TMS cívek. Přesto dosud existuje pouze pět studií, které zkoumaly využití této metody u pacientů s hraniční poruchou osobnosti. Na našem pracovišti jsme v rámci předchozího grantového projektu zahájili pilotní studii rTMS pravého dorzolaterálního prefrontálního kortexu u pacientů s hraniční poruchou osobnosti. Předchozí studie i naše pilotní data naznačují, že se jedná o velmi slibnou metodu pro redukci akutní potíží u těchto pacientů.  Současná studie je proto randomizovanou shamovou stimulací kontrolovanou studií účinků prefrontální rTMS u pacientů s hraniční poruchou osobnosti. Do aktivní i shamové větve bude zařazeno 15 pacientů, kteří podstoupí třítýdenní stimulační protokol zahrnující 15 sezení. Měřeny budou efekty stimulaci na klinické i neurální úrovni, k čemuž bude využito měření pomocí magnetické rezonance i EEG. Sledován bude jak bezprostřední efekt rTMS, tak také jeho udržitelnost v odstupu tří až šesti týdnů.",

Navzdory velkému množství dostupné literatury a studií zůstávají mechanismus patogeneze, spolehlivé klinické markery progrese a potenciální léčba AN neznámé. Pokročilé techniky hmotnostní spektrometrii otevírají nové možnosti ke studiu biomarkerů AN.

   "annotation": "Projekt se zaměřuje na srovnání vybraných metod real-time extrakce BOLD signálu, tedy základního prvku pro fMRI neurofeedback. Během fMRI neurofeedbacku participant v magnetické rezonanci dostává zpětnou vazbu o aktuální úrovni své mozkové aktivity, resp. BOLD signálu, v určité předem definované oblasti mozku. Aktuální signál je poskytován s minimálním zpoždění (např. 1 až 2 sekund). Úkolem participanta je snažit se pomocí zpětné vazby ovlivnit úroveň své mozkové aktivity určitým směrem (tedy např. zvýšit, nebo snížit), a tím se participant učí záměrně regulovat aktivitu svého mozku. fMRI neurofeedback byl v posledních letech úspěšně využit pro zlepšení řady psychiatrických či neurologických obtíží, jako jsou emoční regulace, tinnitus, halucinace či motorické a kognitivní funkce. Menší pozornost je však věnována technickým parametrům fMRI neurofeedbacku, které hrají zásadní roli pro přesné a úspěšné využití této metody. Při extrakci real-time BOLD signálu z určité oblasti je zapotřebí tento signál očistit od globálního signálu mozku a šumu. Tento krok je zásadní pro podobu signálu prezentovaného jako feedback participantům a udává, nakolik tento signál přesně koresponduje s vlastní mozkovou aktivitou. Na projektu spolupracujeme s pracovištěm Centrálního institutu pro duševní zdraví v Mannheimu v Německu, které se výzkumem fMRI neurofeedbacku dlouhodobě zabývá. Tři skupiny zdravých osob (15 osob na skupinu) podstoupí stejný úkol zaměřený na záměrnou regulaci aktivity amygdaly pomocí fMRI neurofeedbacku, který bude každé skupině prezentován pomocí extrakce signálu jednou ze tří vybraných metod. Bude srovnávána přesnost extrahovaného real-time BOLD signálu a úspěšnost regulace amygdaly mezi jednotlivými metodami. Data budou sbírána zároveň v České republice a v Německu. Výsledky přinesou nové poznatky o zásadním aspektu metody fMRI neurofeedbacku.",

Správně fungující cílium je nezbytnou součástí zdravého vývoje a stárnutí všech ciliovaných organismů včetně člověka. V naší nedávno publikované práci jsme zjistili, ze signálování FGF (fibroblast growth factor) je velmi rozšířeným způsobem regulace délky a funkce cília, a že choroby spjaté s aberantní FGF signalizací jako je achondroplazie jsou cíliopatie. V předkládané práci přicházíme s objasněním molekulárního mechanismu interakce FGF s cíliem a tím je interakce FGF receptorů s kinázou ICK (intestinal cell kinase). ICK je známým a evolučně konzervovaným regulátorem délky a funkce primárního cília. Delece ICK vede k deregulaci délky cília, a ztráta kinázové aktivity u člověka vede k letálním skeletálním cíliopatiím a asociuje s nádory. V této práci jsme zjistili, že FGF receptor interaguje s ICK, fosforyluje ICK na několika tyrozinech a tím částečně snižuje její kinázovou aktivitu a mění délku a činnost cília. Tyto výsledky prohlubují naše chápání fyziologické funkce cília, ale také principů vzniku a rozvoje patologií jakými jsou kosterní cíliopatie a nádory.",

Cílem našeho projektu je výzkum vzájemných souvislostí mezi imunitním systémem, možným nízkoprahovým zánětem bílé hmoty mozkové, stavem psychopatologie u nemocných a kognicí a sociální kognicí. Za tímto účelem nabere celkem 38 pacientů se schizofrenií v různém stádiu onemocnění a 38 dobrovolníků matchovaných na věk, vzdělání a pohlaví. U každého probanda probereme imunologické odběry (18 různých cytokinů mapujících stav imunitního systému), psychologické vyšetření kognice a sociální kognice a vyšetření v magnetické rezonanci se zaměřením na bílou hmotu mozkovou (Diffusion Tensor Imaging - DTI). Výstupem projektu pak bude hledat možné souvislosti a koreláty mezi cytokiny, neurozobrazovacími metodami, psychopatologií, kognicí a sociální kognicí. Výsledku budou publikovány v impaktovaných mezinárodních časopisech a mohly by posloužit k lepšími pochopení etiopatogeneze tohoto onemocnění a tím umožnit i kauzálněji zaměřenou léčbu, např. zaměřenou na imunomodulaci.",

Rodina RTK se skládá z mnoha různých receptorů, z nich je každý aktivován svým specifickým ligandem, ale vesměs každý aktivuje vnitrobuněčnou kinázu ERK. Současné výsledky ukazují, že vnitrobuněčné regulátory řídí dobu a sílu ERK aktivace, a tak určují specifickou buněčnou odpověď na signalizaci dané RTK. Tyto regulátory, či adaptory, jsou však většinou neznámé, a navíc dosud není způsob, jak kvalifikovaně posoudit specifitu určitého regulátoru pro konkrétní RTK. Pokud bychom mohli ve všech buňkách s aktivní RTK signalizací odstranit určitý RTK adaptér, tak bychom srovnáním míry aktivace ERK kinázy mohli určit, pro kterou RTK signalizaci je určitý adaptér specifický. Tato znalost by nám pak výrazně usnadnila vývoj léků na onemocnění způsobené mutací v RTK. Léky by totiž mohly být vyvíjeny tak, aby působily přímo na adaptér specifický pro určitou signální dráhu, čímž by se výrazně omezily jejich vedlejší účinky.",

   "annotation": "Maligní melanom je agresivní zhoubný nádor, jenž jen vzácně odpovídá na standardní chemoterapii či radioterapii. Cílená terapie se zaměřuje zejména na signální dráhu kinázy ERK, která je ve většině melanomů aktivována mutacemi onkogenů BRAF nebo NRAS. Nové inhibitory BRAF mohou zbrzdit postup onemocnění, většinou však dojde k vývoji rezistence na léčbu. Naše nedávno publikované výsledky naznačují existenci dříve nepopsaného regulačního mechanismu, na němž se podílí proteiny z rodiny KSR (Kinase suppressor of RAS) a řídí jej energetický senzor AMPK, jenž po působení metabolického stresu v buňkách melanomu aktivně moduluje dráhu ERK aktivovanou onkogeny. Předkládaný projekt využije proteomické přístupy a metody molekulární a buněčné biologie k objasnění molekulárních mechanismů, jejichž prostřednictvím reguluje kináza AMPK v buňkách melanomu interakce proteinů KSR s kinázami RAF a aktivitu dráhy ERK. Pochopení těchto nových mechanismů by mohlo vést k novým možnostem léčby nádorů s mutací NRAS a melanomů nesoucích mutaci BRAF V600E, u nichž se vyvinula rezistence k inhibitorům BRAF.",

Komplexní pochopení exprese a funkce CBS, CSE a MPST v nádorových buňkách není zatím stále zcela objasněno. Na základě dosavadních poznatků jsme vytvořili následující hypotézu: na funkci enzymů produkujících H2S by mohla mít vliv jejich lokalizace a míra jejich kompartmentalizace, změny pH a oxidační stav. Při hypoxii by mohla být ovlivněna endogenní produkce H2S a také funkce enzymů produkujících H2S. Hlavním cílem této studie je tedy popsat souvislosti mezi lokalizací, expresí a funkcí jednotlivých H2S produkujících enzymů ve vybraných nádorových buňkách.

Tato korelace bývá popisována u 30-40 % epileptiků. V rámci příznaků pozorujeme nejen časté epileptické záchvaty, ale i problémy s pamětí, depresivitu a změny osobnosti (Brázdil et al, 2004). Mechanismus vzniku hipokampální sklerózy, které předcházely febrilní křeče není doposud objasněn. V zahraniční literatuře existují studie podporující přímou korelaci mezi febrilními křečemi a následným vznikem hipokampální sklerózy (Kuks et al, 1993), dále průkaz atrofie hipokampu po febrilních křečích (Darrell et al, 2014). Na druhou stranu jsou publikovány i studie, které tuto teorii nepodporují a přiklání se k myšlence, že mozek je již primárně poškozen, následně dojde k rozvoji febrilních křečí a to způsobí poškození již pozměněného hipokampu, jeho edém a atrofii (Keith et al, 1996, Simon et al, 2000). V rámci České Republiky prozatím neexistuje studie zabývající se touto problematikou. Naším cílem je tedy vypracování retrospektivní studie a potvrzení či vyvrácení korelace mezi výskytem febrilních křečí a rozvojem hipokampální sklerózy.",

Naše výzkumná otázka byla jednoduchá a zároveň esenciální – potřebují tyto buňky centrozom, a pokud ano, k čemu?  Naše výsledky, získané kombinací několika molekulárně-biologických přístupů, odhalily naprostou nezbytnost centrozomu pro sebeobnovu (\"self renewal\") lidských pluripotentních buněk, tedy pro zachování pluripotence), nikoliv však pro buněčné dělení jako takové. Navazující experimenty ukázaly, že molekulární podstatou námi objeveného fenoménu je prodloužený čas mitózy a změny v metabolismu proteinů klíčových pro pluripotenci a diferenciaci (p53, Oct4, Nanog).

Objektivní výstup tohoto vyšetření nabízí až jeho, dosud rutinně nevyužívané,  pokročilé zpracování na principu statistického parametrického mapování (SPM), které lze provést dvěma metodami – global normalization (GN – konfirmace pacientských hodnot ke zdravým kontrolám) a asymmetry index (AI – side-to-side analýza u jednoha pacienta). Vzhledem k tomu, že kortikální funkční aktivita, kterou lze definovat na podkladě lokálních metabolických změn právě pomocí PET vyšetření, podléhá zrání a v různém věkovém období jsou různé části kortexu více aktivní než jiné, je obtížné vytvořit univerzální dětskou normu. Cílem projektu je proto porovnání obou SPM metodik u dětských pacientů a zhodnocení, zda lze kontrolní skupinu dospělých pacientů využít i pro dětskou populaci.",

   "annotation": "V posledních desetiletích zaznamenaly moderní diagnostické postupy a intervence navigované zobrazovacími metodami zásadní pokrok při léčbě onkologických pacientů. Zdokonalením prošly nejen diagnostické zobrazovací metody, ale paralelně s nimi i techniky invazivní endovaskulární či intratumorální léčby. Pokrok v diagnostice umožňuje vyhledávání zhoubného onemocnění v jeho časných stadiích, umožňuje podrobněji charakterizovat nemocnou tkáň pacienta, získáváme informace o individuálních vlastnostech konkrétní léze. Integrace nálezů těchto nových diagnostických metod do terapeutického plánu pacienta umožňuje individualizaci postupů v moderní onkologické léčbě. Miniinvazivní radiologicko-onkologické intervence využívají zobrazovací metody nejen při zákroku, ale jako první z terapeutických metod mohou využít spektrum pokročilých zobrazovacích metod ke sledování léčebné odpovědi. Cílem projektu je analýza přínosu specifických diagnostických a terapeutických postupů využívaných v Komplexním onkologickém centru Masarykova onkologického ústavu v Brně ve spolupráci s Fakultní nemocnicí Brno a Fakultní nemocnicí U Svaté Anny ve srovnání s celorepublikovými daty. Výzkum bude zaměřen na modalitu PET/MR, pokročilé volumetrické analýzy, korelace radiologických a molekulárních markerů (miRNA). Výsledky léčby u vybraných diagnóz primárních nádorů jater (hepatocelulární karcinom, cholangiocelulární karcinom) a sekundárních nádorů jater (zejména metastázy kolorektálního karcinomu), u kterých byly využity radiologické intervenční přístupy budou kriticky zhodnoceny ve srovnání s daty z jiných komplexních onkologických center, kde pokročilé metody nebyly dostupné. Projekt navazuje na projekt specifického výzkumu řešeného v roce 2015 na naší klinice v rámci projektů Lékařské fakulty Masarykovy univerzity.",

Hlavní překážka v efektivní léčbě glioblastomu je jeho invazivní růst do peritumorózní mozkové tkáně limitující efekt resekce a dále jeho intratumorózní biologická heterogenita oslabující účinnost terapie onkologické. Reziduální onemocnění v peritumorózní mozkové zóně je léčeno onkologicky na základě analýzy tkáně masy tumoru, která byla odstraněna při operaci. S ohledem na vysokou intratumorózní heterogenitu si ovšem nemůžeme být jisti, že charakteristika reziduálního onemocnění je stejná, jaká byla popsána ve tkáni získané operací. Tento fakt může zodpovídat za selhání dosavadních snah o cílenou biologickou léčbu u glioblastomu. Cílem projektu je studium a popis heterogenity významných histopatologických biomarkerů na resekční hranici glioblastomu, tedy na hranici tumor – peritumorózní oblast nádorové infiltrace, na kterou je cílená adjuvantní onkologická léčba. Lepší pochopení reziduálního onemocnění v peritumorózní mozkové zóně je kritické pro odhalení mechanizmů zodpovědných za recidivu glioblastomu s cílem optimalizoval chirurgickou resekci a vyvinout nové terapeutické postupy.",

Pacienti budou termograficky vyšetřeni během plánovaného chirurgického výkonu. Specifita projektu je dána porovnáním dynamické termografie a ICG, dvou moderních metod pro stanovení kvality prokrvení. Dle dosavadních zjištění tyto metody nebyly prozatím klinicky srovnány.",

Cílem je další rozvoj dosažených originálních výsledků v personalizovaném léčebném přístupu u dětí s refrakterními a relabujícími solidními nádory a non-Hodgkinovými lymfomy (NHL). Námi prováděné analýzy nádorové tkáně zahrnují transkripční profilování, sekvenování nové generace (NGS) - TruSight Tumor panel a NGS Agilent (whole exome/genome sequencing); a detekci fosforylace receptorových kináz a MAP kináz proteomickými metodami. Od roku 2017 jsme zavedli do komplexního vyšetřovacího panelu též detekci specifických translokací/genových fúzí (RNAseq). Námi navrhovaný komplexní rozvoj vyšetřování nádorové tkáně (histopatologie, genomické, transkriptomické a fosfoproteomické vyšetření) spolu s bioinformatickou podporou, vedou k prohloubení našich znalostí o molekulárním profilu nádoru a genetickém pozadí hostitele. Na základě dosavadních analýz bylo možno aplikovat personalizovanou léčbu, na základě doporučení expertního panelu (molecular tumor board), u přibližně 60 % případů. Očekáváme, že dalším prohloubením tohoto inovativního přístupu a jeho aplikací v klinické praxi dosáhneme dalšího zlepšení léčebných odpovědí u významného procenta dětí s refrakterními malignitami. Důraz na opakované vyšetření nádorové tkáně téhož pacienta (opakované biopsie při recidivých/progresích, klonální vývoj) sleduje nejmodernější trendy v onkologii a směřuje k postupům tzv. „liquid dynamic medicine“ a „N-of-1 clinical trials“.",

V uplynulém roce byl dokončen sběr dat ve studii elektrofyziologických korelátů emoční regulace u pacientek s poruchami příjmu potravy a dále probíhá sběr dat ve studii fenotypů impulzivity a jejich neurálních korelátů u pacientů s hraniční poruchou osobnosti, ADHD a Parkinsonovou chorobou a ve studii sociální kognice u pacientů se schizofrenií. V příštím roce se zaměříme zejména na přípravu publikací originálních dat. Dále pokračujeme v léčbě negativních příznaků u schizofrenie a impulzivity u hraniční poruchy osobnosti a ADHD pomocí repetitivní transkraniální magnetické stimulace (rTMS). Vysokofrekvenční stimulaci pravého dorzolaterálního prefrontálního kortexu s využitím individualizované neuronavigace podstoupilo zatím 10 pacientů s hraniční poruchou osobnosti. Léčba byla dobře tolerována, pacienti po stimulaci referovali zlepšení emoční regulace, snížení impulzivity či zlepšení nálady a pozornosti. V dalším kroku se zaměříme na možnost využití intenzifikovaného protokolu v léčbě impulzivity. Na našem pracovišti jsme dále ve spolupráci s Cental Institute of Mental Health v Mannheimu zahájili nový projekt zaměřený na fMRI neurofeedback. Jedná se o inovativní metodu, díky které se pacienti učí záměrně ovlivňovat aktivitu určité části svého mozku pomocí online feedbacku aktuální mozkové aktivity při měření fMRI. Technologie byla již implementována na pracovišti Ceitec a aktuálně probíhají pilotní měření. Pomocí fMRI neurofeedbacku se zaměříme na posilování schopnosti regulace emocí u různých skupin pacientů s určitým způsobem narušenou schopností emoční regulace, a sice u pacientů s hraniční poruchou osobnosti, mentální anorexií a bipolární poruchou.",

Mezi hlavní cíle péče o takto postižené osoby tedy patří pokud možno úplná eradikace choroby nebo alespoň dosažení dlouhodobé remise, aby se nemocný mohl co nejvíce vrátit k dosavadnímu způsobu života.\nZ tohoto hlediska se jako velmi důležité jeví nejen časné rozpoznání nemoci, ale také její přesné diagnostikování a následné podání odpovídající terapie. Velkým příslibem budoucnosti je snaha o personalizovanou medicínu, kdy je léčba upravena přímo pro daného pacienta tzv. na míru, čímž jsou minimalizovány její nežádoucí účinky. \nV průběhu terapie se často vyskytují komplikace infekčního charakteru a velmi často bývají také příčinou úmrtí nemocného. Je tedy nezbytné včas a správně rozpoznat původce infekce a podat účinnou léčbu.",

Hlavním cílem současného projektu je studium zánětlivých změn v plexus choroideus (CP) laboratorního potkana po navození subarachnoidálního krvácení (SAK). Projekt bude zaměřen na studium exprese hemoxygenázy 1 (HO-1), biliverdin reduktázy (BVR), toll-like receptoru (TLR) 4 a 9.\nNa experimentálním modelu laboratorního potkana bylo zjištěno, že SAK indukuje proliferaci buněk CP a zánětlivou reakci reprezentovanou invazí aktivovaných makrofágů. Rozvoj zánětlivých změn je přisuzován rozpadovým produktům krve, především hemu, šířícím se likvorovými cestami k buňkám CP. Enzym HO-1 a BVR zvyšují odbourávaní hemoglobinu po SAK. Tyto enzymy byly popsané v různých částech mozku kromě CP. Domníváme, že zvýšená exprese HO-1 a BVR může přispět k rozvoji zánětlivých změn v CP po SAK. Je známo, že TLR9 a TLR4 mohou ovlivňovat spoje typu zonulae occludentes. Předpokládáme, že rozpadové produkty krve v subarachnoidálním prostoru mohou zvyšovat expresi TLR4 a TLR9 a tím vyvolat oslabení hematolikvorové bariéry a rozvoj nitrolební hypertenze po SAK. \nVyužitím stereotaktického rámu bude u experimentální skupiny zvířat aplikováno 200μl autologní arteriální krve do prechiasmatické cisterny. U kontrolní skupiny bude aplikováno 200μl artificiálního mozkomíšního moku. Zvířata obou skupin budou přežívat 1, 3 nebo 7 dnů. Experimentální, kontrolní a intaktní zvířata budou usmrcena inhalací CO2 a fixována. Z odebraných mozků budou zhotoveny koronální kryostatové řezy, na kterých bude provedena imunohistochemická detekce HO-1, BVR, TLR4 a TLR9.",

Cílovou skupinou projektu jsou studenti pedagogické fakulty, kteří na počátku sledování vyplní dotazník zjišťující základní rysy jejich aktuálního životního stylu a podstoupí vědomostní pretest na téma dlouhodobých dopadů životního stylu. Následovat bude seminář objasňující zejména časové a kvalitativní souvislosti životního stylu a rozvoje chorob se závažným dopadem na soběstačnost a kvalitu života ve vyšším věku. Vzdělávání bude doplněno měřením obvodu pasu s následnou analýzou složení tělesných tkání, na základě jejíhož výsledku bude doporučen individuální stravovací a pohybový režim na dobu tří měsíců. Po uplynutí této doby bude opakovaná analýza a vědomostní posttest a od probandů budou zjištěny informace týkající se jejich compliance v průběhu projektu a jejich motivace k dlouhodobé změně životního stylu. Prostřednictvím výsledků kontrolního měření a vyhodnocení posttestu bude student motivován k dalšímu pokračování nebo zintenzivnění režimu. V další fázi projektu budou cílovou skupinou žáci devátých tříd a studenti středních škol, kteří absolvují totéž schéma intervence v podání studentů pedagogické fakulty. Zprostředkováním své vlastní zkušenosti přispějí studenti pedagogické fakulty ke zvýšení motivace adolescentů a tím i efektu intervence ve smyslu zvýšení své i jejich zdravotní gramotnosti. Předpokládá se účast 300 studentů pedagogické fakulty a 600 žáků základních škol a studentů středních škol. V rámci řešení projektu bude vyhodnocena souvislost znalostí probanda a složení jeho tělesných tkání a obvodu pasu, efekt intervence na tyto faktory v závislosti na přiznané complianci probanda a multifaktoriální analýza faktorů ovlivňujících motivaci ke změně životního stylu.

Cílem projektu je sledovat efektivitu a porovnat jednotlivé možnosti rehabilitace sluchu (kochleární implantace, sluchadla, BAHA, středoušní implantáty) u dětí různých věkových kategorií a s různými typy sluchových vad. Projekt navazuje na výsledky výzkumu z roku 2017.",

Difficult airway je spojen se signifikantní morbiditou a mortalitou dětských pacientů v perioperační péči. \nÚvod a odborná charakteristika:\nMajorita difficult airway v pediatrické populaci je predikovatelná, nicméně obtížné zajištění dýchacích cest a případné selhání ventilace a oxygenace pediatrických pacientů patří mezi nejčastější fatální komplikace spojené s dětskou anestezii. Možnost efektivní predikce obtížného zajištění poskytuje možnost vyhnout se kritické situaci na operačním sále a naplánovat postup pro potenciální obtížné zajištění dýchacích cest (difficult airway). Předoperační zhodnocení a predikce obtížného zajištění dýchacích cest patří mezi standardní části předanestetsického vyšetření, ačkoliv rozsah a testy použity k predikci difficult airway se liší v závislosti od jednotlivého pracoviště. S cílem identifikovat potenciální rizikové pacienty bude u pacientů před plánovanou operaci na anesteziologické ambulanci hodnocena vzdálenost mezi řezáky (nad 3 prsty pacienta, pod 3 prsty pacienta, pod 2 prsty pacienta, méně jak 1 prst pacienta a v cm). Bude hodnocena mobilita krční páteře – volný předklon a záklon. Dále bude měřena thyreomentální vzdálenost – stanovena dle prstů pacienta a cm při maximální extenzi, hodnota Mallampati skore, výška a váha pacienta, dále bude hodnocena protruze mandibuly – upper lip bite test (vše dle spolupráce pacienta). Na operačním sále bude sledována poloha pacienta k operačnímu výkonu (horizontální, podložka pod hlavou podložka pod rameny), metoda zajištění dýchacích cest (obličejová masky, LM, intuabace), úspěšnost metody (1., 2., pokus, nutnost alternativního zajištění dýchacích cest) použití myorelaxancií. Bude hodnocen výskyt obtížné ventilace obličejovou maskou, obtížného zavedení laryngeální masky, obtížné laryngoskopie a situace cannot intubace/cannot ventilate – CICV. Statistickými metodami bude hodnocena prediktabilita jednotlivých testů k predikci Cormack-Leehane ≥3.\nHypotéza:\nVýskyt difficult airway v pediatrické populaci je málo frekventní ve srovnání s dospělou populaci a majorita obtížného zajištění DC v pediatrické populaci je predikovatelná pomocí standardních testů",

V teoretické části je rozvedena problematika heteroforií a souvisejích pojmů, praktická část se poté zabývá samotným měřením. \n\nHeteroforie je vlastně skryté šilhání, jde o poruchu okohybných svalů, která však není na pohled patrná. Pacientům může způsobovat bolesti hlavy, pálení očí nebo dvojité vidění. Často se dostavují i astenopické potíže, což je neostré, mlhavé vidění, které je způsobené oční únavou. Tyto obtíže se projevují především při práci do blízka, v současné době se tato problematika týká hlavně práce s počítačem. Práce se tedy zaměří na pacienty, kteří trpí heteroforií a na to, jak tato porucha ovlivňuje jejich práci na počítači. Každý pacient vyplní dotazník, který bude zaměřen na věk, pohlaví a dále informace týkající se práce s počítačem (doba, kterou tráví u počítače nebo otázky týkající se výše zmíněných příznaků). Poté bude změřena jejich subjektivní refrakce a hodnota heteroforie do dálky i na počítačovou vzdálenost (70 cm). Druhou částí výzkumu je použití eye-trackingu pro měření rychlosti očních pohybů u pacientů s heteroforií na začátku a po několika hodinách práce s počítačem za předpokladu, že heteroforie bude negativně ovlivňovat rychlost očních pohybů a tedy efektivitu jejich pracovního výkonu.\n\nZávěrem práce bude ověřit stanovené hypotézy a navrhnout nové možnosti korekce pro tyto pacienty. Zároveň půjde o inovativní použití eye-trackeru v oblasti optometrie.",

   "annotation": "Alzheimerova nemoc (AN) je nejčastější příčina demence ve stárnoucí populaci, její incidence vzrůstá s věkem a ve věku nad 85 let trpí téměř polovina populace AN. Onemocnění je charakterizováno poruchou krátkodobé episodické paměti, ale již v časném stádiu onemocnění, tj. mírné kognitivní poruchy (MPK-AN) dochází rovněž k poruše zrakové pozornosti a zrakově-prostorových funkcí. Parkinsonova nemoc (PN) je druhé nejčastější neurodegenerativní onemocnění mozku po AN. Prevalence PN je obecně odhadovaná na 0.3 % v celé populaci a na 1% v populaci nad 60 let. K výraznému nárůstu incidence dochází po 60. roce života. Mimo charakteristické progresivní pohybové postižení je PN často doprovázena psychickými změnami. Kognitivní poruchy postihují 80% nemocných a již v časných fázích PN má 20-25% pacientů objektivní kognitivní deficit, který splňuje kritéria pro mírnou kognitivní poruchu při PN (MKP-PN). Přítomnost MKP-PN je rizikovým faktorem pro vznik demence u PN. Mezi nejčastější kognitivní deficity v časném stadiu PN patří dysexekutivní syndrom a poruchy zpracování zrakových informací. Přes značný výzkum v této oblasti nejsou neurobiologické mechanismy vedoucí ke vzniku kognitivní poruchy u pacientů s PN stále dostatečně známy. Demence při AN i PN má negativní dopad na soběstačnost pacienta, sociální a pracovní zařazení, kvalitu života pacienta i pečovatele a je spojena s významným zvýšením morbidity/mortality. Včasná identifikace pacientů s rizikem vzniku MKP a demence při AN a PN je proto důležitou prioritou. \nV projektu budeme zkoumat behaviorální a neurální koreláty zpracování zrakových informací a jejich poruch u pacientů s PN s a bez přítomnosti kognitivního deficitu a u pacientů s MKP-AN. U pacientů s MKP-AN budeme navíc sledovat neurální koreláty paměťových poruch hodnocených testem asociačního učení. Multimodální zobrazování mozku pomocí magnetické rezonance (MRI) v kombinaci s neinvazivní mozkovou stimulací (NIMS), jakou je repetitivní transkraniální magnetická stimulace (rTMS) a transkraniální stimulace stejnosměrným proudem (tDCS), slouží jako další nástroj pro odhalení patofyziologických mechanismů kognitivních a behaviorálních symptomů. Navíc pomocí NIMS můžeme navodit změny plasticity a funkce mozku. A tyto změny mohou dále vést k potenciálně léčebným účinkům na kognitivní funkce.",

Dále provedeme analýzu rozdílů molekulární signalizace u morfologicky rozeznatelných typů odontogenních nádorů a studium vlivu komerčně dostupných inhibitorů na růst buněčných linií založených z tkáně pacientů. Nové potenciální cíle molekulární terapie budou detekovány pomocí RNA sekvenace buněk pacientů. Výsledky našeho projektu poskytnou nový pohled na pochopení patogeneze odontogenních tumorů a nabídnou další možnosti testování léků zaměřených na FGF nebo SHH aktivující mutace jako nových terapií pro jejich léčbu.",

S pouhou třetinou pacientů přežívajících kritickou pětiletou periodu od stanovení diagnózy patří mezi nádory prognosticky nepříznivé. V 90 % jde o maligní nádory epitelového původu, mezi nimiž patří k nejfrekventovanějším spinocelulární karcinom, na který je zaměřen náš projekt. Prognóza onemocnění zhoubným nádorem dutiny ústní a orofaryngu je dána především stupněm invazivity primárního tumoru a rozsahem metastatického postižení regionálních a vzdálených uzlin. Intenzita perineurální invaze koreluje s lokalizací nádoru, jeho rozsahem a přítomností uzlinových metastáz. V našem projektu se zaměříme zejména na analýzu molekulárních markerů perineurální invaze a na interakci nádorové tkáně s okolními tkáněmi. Primárním cílem projektu je   zavést do rutinní histopatologické diagnostiky nové postupy umožňující lépe plánovat další terapii. Dále se zaměříme na zavedení nové metodiky umožňující sledovat dynamiku nádorových markerů v krvi  pacientů po chirurgickém zákroku s cílem včas determinovat cirkulující nádorové buňky a tím co nejdříve predikovat návrat nemoci a zahájit tak okamžitá terapeutická opatření.",

Inhibice BCR-ABL aktivity pomocí TK inhibitorů (TKI) představuje standard v léčbě CML. Ačkoliv většina pacientů pozitivně reaguje na administraci TKI, jejich použití nevede k eradikaci choroby. Nedávno vyvinutý alosterický inhibitor ABL001 slibuje překonání rezistence vůči TKI tím, že umožňuje dvojí inhibici BCR-ABL. Rané klinické hodnocení ABL001 ukázalo silnou a trvalou odpověď u pacientů s TKI-rezistentní CML, ale také významnou toxicitu, která může narušovat budoucí ABL001 terapii. Molekulární mechanismy vedlejších účinků nejsou známy a jsou předmětem tohoto návrhu. Hlavním cílem předkládaného projektu je charakterizovat aktivitu ABL001 vůči všem známým lidským tyrosin kinázám in vitro a in vivo, a najít tak další cíle ABL001.

   "annotation": "Hypertenze (HT) a obstrukční spánková apnoe (OSA) vykazují vysokou prevalenci v populaci, představují rizikové faktory dalších nemocí a jsou vzájemně funkčně propojeny - špatná kompenzace jedné z nich zhoršuje kompenzaci druhé. Zatímco HT je možné diagnostikovat změřením tlaku krve (TK), diagnostika OSA vyžaduje finančně, technicky i časově náročné polysomnografické vyšetření, což je jeden z důvodů, proč je OSA poddiagnostikována. Navíc, z doposud neobjasněných příčin, jen někteří pacienti s HT reagují na terapii kontinuálním pozitivním přetlakem (CPAP) snížením TK; dosažení cílových hodnot TK je přitom zásadní pro snížení kardiovaskulárního rizika.\nNové markery, které by umožnily snadnější diagnostiku OSA nebo odhad pacientovy reakce na terapii, by mohly přispět k časnějšímu zahájení terapie u responzivních pacientů. Těmito markery by mohly být cirkulující mikroRNA – lehce dostupné (např. plasma) a stabilní molekuly, jejichž hladiny se mění vlivem různých stimulů (např. zvýšení TK, hypoxie) a mohou tak sloužit k diagnostice a odhadu prognózy u pacientů s HT a OSA.\nPrimární cíl projektu je identifikace mikroRNA, které bude možné použít pro diagnostiku/skreening OSA u pacientů s hypertenzí. Sekundární cíl je u pacientů se zjištěnou OSA identifikovat mikroRNA, které budou predikovat snížení krevního tlaku po zahájení terapie kontinuálním pozitivním přetlakem (CPAP), tedy identifikovat ty pacienty, kteří z terapie pomocí CPAP budou nejvíce profitovat. \nCelkem je v plánu nabrat 300 pacientů, přičemž soubor této velikosti má dle našich primárních dat 90% pravděpodobnost, že na hladině významnosti 0,05 prokáže statistické rozdíly mezi skupinami ve vybraných miRNA.",

Ke komplikacím ze strany kardiovaskulárního systému (KVS) patří mimo jiné bradyarytmie, kardiomyopatie, diastolická dysfunkce, srdeční selhání, ortostatická hypotenze, ateroskleróza, zvýšená tuhost arteriální stěny, hluboká žilní trombóza, embolizace. Prací zabývajících se jednotlivými komplikacemi u pacientů se SCI bylo mnoho, ale jen málo studií obsahovalo vícerozměrné sledování KVS. Častým nedostatkem studií byla chybějící analýza přesného poškození ANS. Tato studie se proto zaměří na komplexní neinvazivní vyšetření kardiovaskulárního systému u pacientů se SCI za použití běžných i novějších metod, které zatím u SCI nebyly použity. Změny KVS budou analyzovány v souvislosti s přesnou kvantifikací dysfunkce ANS (včetně katecholaminů). Cílem studie je pochopit a předvídat vznik či zhoršení onemocnění KVS u pacientů se SCI.",

V současnosti používaná platinová chemoterapeutika však s sebou nesou vážné vedlejší účinky, které jsou projevem jejich kumulativní toxicity a nespecifického mechanizmu působení (neschopnosti cílit selektivně na nádorové buňky). Protinádorová terapie by proto mohla významně profitovat z cíleného transportu léčiv a jejich selektivní aktivace v nádorové tkáni. Cílení a stimulovaná aktivace by chránila pacienta před řadou vedlejších účinků souvisejících s transformacemi léčiva v játrech a během jeho přenosu v krevním řečišti.\nV současnosti existuje velká poptávka po návrhu a vývoji nové generace protinádorových metaloléčiv a proléčiv založených na sloučeninách platiny a ruthenia, stejně jako chytrých nosičů pro již existující léčiva schválená Úřadem pro výživu a léky v USA (FDA). CAR4DRUG reaguje na tuto výzvu vývojem a nasazením inovativního přístupu, komplexně řešícího strategii dopravy léčiva prostřednictvím nanoklecí. Projekt bude dále rozvíjet a zkoumat třídu molekulárních klecí odvozených od cyklických oligosacharidů a resorcinarenů, které jsou strukturně uzpůsobeny danému léčivu, cílí na nádorové tkáně a díky vhodně navrženým vazebným spojením uvolňují léčiva na místě určení.

Z analýz Světové banky i dalších zdrojů je víc než zřejmé, že zvyšováni světové populace, kterého jsme svědky, je vázáno především na zvyšování střední doby života a ne na porodnost, a to zejména ve vyspělých zemích světa . Země jako například Japonsko, které vykazuje třetí nejhorší porodnost na světě , již intenzivně pociťují negativní trendy ve stárnutí populace. \nStejně jako ve světě, i u nás můžeme rozpoznat dva významné trendy ve vývoji poruch reprodukce. Jednak značná část populace, ve vyspělých zemích okolo 15% , nemůže počít přirozenou cestou, ačkoli příčina není zcela známá. Další část populace odkládá reprodukci na pozdější dobu, kdy je mateřství spojeno s velkými riziky jako pro matku tak i pro plod. Uvedené trendy vedou ke stále se zvyšující potřebě technik asistované reprodukce. Zásadním problémem těchto metod je ovšem selhání vývoje vajíček a embryí a jejich neschopnost vytvořit plnohodnotný lidský plod. \nVýzkum v oblasti poruch lidské reprodukce, tak jako i výzkum v oblasti nových technik asistované reprodukce je nejen u nás, ale i ve světě trvale podfinancován. V kontrastu s jinými medicínsky významnými problémy je podpora výzkumu poruch reprodukce na národní úrovni velmi málo zastoupená a platforma přímé podpory výzkumu tohoto typu prakticky neexistuje. A přitom je zřejmé, že reprodukční problémy představují do budoucna celosvětově obrovský socioekonomický problém. Využití metod asistované reprodukce bude vykazovat stále vrůstající tendenci. \nRealizací aktivit projektu se chceme pokusit tento nedostatek do jisté míry napravit a soustředit se na špičkový výzkum v oblastech týkajících se příčin selhání časného vývoje oocytů a embryí.

Targeted therapy\nof melanoma is aimed mainly at the ERK kinase signalling pathway, activated in most melanomas by BRAF or\nNRAS oncogenic mutations. BRAF inhibitors can delay the progression of the disease, but they usually cannot\ncure it.\nRecent findings show an important role of the activated ERK pathway in the characteristic reprogramming of\ncancer cell energy metabolism, potentially offering new therapeutic targets. However, our recent data suggest\nthe presence of a previously unknown feedback mechanism, promoting further activation of the ERK pathway in\ncancer cells in response to metabolic stress, in a manner dependent on the type of oncogenic mutation driving\nERK pathway activity.\nThe proposed project will unravel molecular mechanisms linking cell energy metabolism to the ERK pathway in\nBRAF- and NRAS-mutated cancer cells. We will concentrate on the roles of the interactions of RAF, KSR, and\nAMPK proteins that were identified in our experiments as critical regulators of MEK/ERK activity in melanoma\ncells treated with small molecule inhibitors of cell energy metabolism.\nBased on our preliminary data, we believe that by analysing the response of cancer cells to metabolic stress and\ntheir dependence on individual metabolic pathways for survival, our project could also define combinations of\ndrugs targeting cell metabolism suitable as alternative treatments for cases when malignant melanoma tumours\nbecome resistant to clinically used BRAF inhibitors.",

   "annotation": "Jednou z největších překážek při produkci pluripotentních kmenových buněk (hPSCs) pro regenerativní medicínu je adaptace buněk, doprovázená destabilizací genomu. K ochraně genomu mají hPSC zvýšenu aktivitu bázově excizního opravy DNA (BER) a homologní rekombinace (HR), zatímco aktivita nehomologního spojování konců DNA a alternativního spojování na základě mikrohomologií (MMEJ) zůstává konstantní. Naše hypotéza tvrdí, že shluky oxidativního poškození bází DNA jsou konvertovány prostřednictvím BER do dvojřetězcových zlomů (DSBs), které jsou dále bezchybně opravovány rychlým MMEJ, zatímco pluripotenci ovládající proteiny spolupracují na ochraně konců DNA před HR a NHEJ. Adaptované hPSC, používají tuto kombinaci drah i pro opravu DSBs vyvolaných zvýšeným replikačním stresem. Výsledkem je chybná oprava a zvýšená frekvence mutací hPSC. Cílem projektu je ověřit tuto hypotézu a ukázat, že chemické přesměrování opravy dvojřetězcových zlomů z MMEJ na HR v adaptovaných hPSC, může omezit četnost mutací a umožnit tak delší a účinnější kultivaci pluripotentních kmenových buněk.",

Mozková tkáň podléhá patologickým změnám ve formě hromadění β-amyloidního plaku (Aβ) a hyperfosforylovaného proteinu Tau. Pro studium AD se v současnosti využívají geneticky modifikované buněčné linie i zvířecí modely, které však nejsou schopny plně rekapitulovat všechny aspekty patologie lidského CNS. Rozvoj biologie kmenových buněk a možnosti jejich získání přímo z pacientů jsou proto velkým příslibem modelování komplexních neurodegenerativních nemocí včetně AD. Recentně bylo ukázáno, že buněčné přeprogramování pacientských buněk do indukovaných pluripotentních kmenových buněk (iPSCs) a následná kultivace tzv. „Cerebrálních organoidů“ in vitro poskytuje nadějnou metodu pro bližší poznání Alzheimerovy choroby (Kim et al., 2015). Tyto 3D kultury Alzheimerovy choroby vykazují klíčové události patogeneze AD, včetně agregace Aβ a hromadění hyperfosforylovaného proteinu Tau a představují tak jedinečný nástroj pro výzkum AD. V České republice takovýto model prozatím nebyl ustaven. \nCílem této práce je vytvořit model 3D cerebrálních organoidů pro studium Alzheimerovy choroby přímo z buněk pacientů a ověřit, zda funkčně rekapitulují znaky AD. V první fázi projektu bude probíhat optimalizace protokolů pro kultivaci 3D cerebrálních organoidů z kmenových buněk, ve druhé fázi pak funkčně ověříme, zda námi ustanovený buněčný model rekapituluje patologii Alzheimerovy choroby. Nad rámec tohoto projektu budou vykultivované 3D cerebrální organoidy sloužit k potvrzení hypotéz týkajících se zastoupení gangliosidů v procesu stárnutí a vzniku AD.   \n \n\nKlíčová slova: 3D organoidy, Alzheimerova choroba, indukované pluripotentní kmenové buňky, neurodiferenciace, neurodegenerativní poruchy",

Tyto procesy vyžadují přesnou časovou a prostorovou regulaci pomocí mnoha signálních drah včetně signalizace přes fibroblastové růstové faktory (FGFs). Signalizace FGF řídí větvící morfogenezi epitelu a reguluje aktivitu kmenových buněk mléčné žlázy. Její narušení (deregulace) vede k vývojovým defektům a k onemocněním, včetně rakoviny prsu, nejčastější malignity žen.\nCílem tohoto projektu je podrobně prozkoumat vliv intenzity a délky signalizace FGF2na větvící morfogenezi epitelu mléčné žlázy pomocí termostabilních variant FGF2 v moderních 3D buněčných kulturách primárních organoidů z myší mléčné žlázy.",

B - buněčný aktivující faktor byl dosud jen úspěšně ověřen v humánní medicíně. Zde velmi výrazně působí na aktivaci B lymfocytů a následně na tvorbu specifických typů protilátek tříd IgG, IgA a IgE. To úzce souvisí s řadou onemocnění, např. alergiemi, autoimunitními chorobami, infekcemi i některými nádorovými onemocněními, u kterých dochází dysregulaci jak buněčné, tak humorální imunity.\nB - buněčný aktivující faktor nebyl dosud ve veterinární medicíně ověřen. Je zde reálný předpoklad, že podobně jako v humánní medicíně, bude výrazně stimulovat imunitní reakce i u zvířecího organismu. \nPotvrzení tohoto zjištění by mělo reálný praktický dopad ve veterinární medicíně. Použití B - buněčného aktivujícího faktoru buď samostatně nebo v kombinaci se séry či vakcínami může napomoci zvýšit imunity či následný protektivní efekt sér a vakcín u vybraných infekčních onemocnění.",

O zbývajících 20-30% hovoříme jako o epilepsiích farmakorezistentních. Farmakorezistence je dle aktuálně platného konsensu definována jako selhání dvou dobře tolerovaných a vhodně zvolených antiepileptik (1). Jsou-li kritéria farmakorezistence splněna, mají být vždy zváženy nefarmakologické možnosti terapie - v první řadě resekční epileptochirurgický výkon, v druhé řadě stimulace nervus vagus (VNS) nebo ketogenní dieta (KD). Na včasnou indikaci nefarmakologických postupů (zejm. resekčních výkonů s kurativním záměrem) je dnes kladen velký důraz, přesto se mnoho pacientů dostává do epileptologických center pozdě, popř. o zmíněných možnostech léčby vůbec nevědí. Primárním cílem našeho projektu je proto vyhledání vhodných kandidátů nefarmakologické léčby, individualizovaná edukace těchto pacientů (resp. rodičů) o benefitech výše pospaných postupů a následně jejich realizace.",

Jedná se zejména o distribuci těchto látek v krevním oběhu a tímto vizualizovat prokrvení jednotlivých částí těla. Hlavní využití \"fluorescent-guided surgery\" vidí autoři v hodnocení prokrvení konců střeva po odstranění patologicky změněné části gastrointestinálního traktu a při jeho dalším napojení. Špatné prokrvení v místě napojení těchto konců může znamenat neúplné nebo žádné hojení nově vytvořené střevní anastomózy, její rozpad a přímé ohrožení pacienta a životě komplikacemi jak bezprostředními, tak i pozdními, kupříkladu pozdržením další onkologické léčby, která je některých pacientů nezbytně nutná. Projekt je především experimentem přímým, kdy fluorescenční technika bude použita chirurgem přímo na operačním sále při resekčním výkonu na gastrointestinálním traktu. Hlavním úkolem této techniky bude zhodnotit prokrvení střeva před našitím konců střeva k sobě a determinovat místo k tomu nevhodnější. Taktéž budou hledány nové směry a procedury, při kterých se vhodnost použití fluorescence předpokládá - zobrazení cévních struktur při preparaci střeva, ozřejmení okrajů plicního segmentu při anatomických resekcích či detekci lymfatických uzlin při resekcích nádorů. Tato technika není ničím neznámým v západních zemích, kde si vydobyla svoje pevné místo na pracovištích nejvyššího významu. Zavedení této techniky do běžné chirurgické praxe na našem pracovišti proto pokládáme za velice významné.",

Je dobře známo, že intenzita oxidačního stresu závisí na závažnosti termického poškození a také na antioxidačním stavu organismu, ale dosud nejsou definovány žádné biochemické parametry (markery oxidativního stresu) související s pravděpodobností  rozvoje infekčních komplikací. Dalším průvodním jevem termického traumatu je rozvoj sytémového zánětu  (SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome) s pozdějšími projevy imunodeficitu, který je také jednou z příčin zvýšené náchylnosti infekcím. Cílem našeho projektu je nalezení souvislostí mezi markery oxidativního stresu a vznikem imunodeficitu a infekce u těžce a kriticky popálených pacientů, které by umožnily na základě  stanovení biochemických parametrů oxidativního stresu individualizaci mikrobiologických vyšetření během léčby. Časový průběh oxidačního stresu u skupiny kriticky popálených pacientů bude monitorován měřením aduktů 4-hydroxynonenalu (4-HNE) a sloučenin reagujících s kyselinou thiobarbiturovou (TBARS) v plazmě, moči a ve vzorcích bronchoalveolární výplachů (Balş) jako markerů peroxidace lipidů a 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosinu (8-OHdG) v moči jako markeru celkového oxidačního poškození DNA. Dále bude sledována antioxidační kapacita plasmy (FRAP), koncentrace nízkomolekulárních thiolů a vitaminů E a A k posouzení stavu antioxidantů v plasmě. Poškození DNA bude sledováno ve frakci leukocytů metodou analýzy komet. Závažnost termického traumatu bude hodnocena prostřednictvím indexu ABSI (abbreviated burn severity index).Vedle základních údajů (věk, pohlaví, BMI, typ pleti, komorbidity, zpoždění terapie v hodinách) bude sledována přítomnost inhalačního traumatu, rozvoj SIRS, infekčních komplikací a budou prováděna rutinní hematologická a imunologická vyšetření. Data, monitorující rozvoj oxidativního stresu budou porovnávána s analýzou zánětlivých markerů - CRP, PCT a běžně používanými markery imunodeficitu a vzniku zánětu (poměr CD4+ / CD8+ T-lymfocytů). S využitím získaných výsledků se pokusíme stratifikovat podle daných parametrů pacienty do skupin a pomocí statistickýc metod vyhledat skupinu pacientů, která nejvíce profituje z aplikace antimikrobiální a antioxidační léčby.",

Navazuje a dále rozvíjí nyní řešený projekt MUNI/A/1417/2015. Cílem je další rozvoj theranostického přístupu u dětí s refrakterními a relabujícími solidními nádory a non-Hodgkinovými lymfomy (NHL). Námi prováděné analýzy nádorové tkáně zahrnují detekci fosforylace receptorových kináz a MAP kináz proteomickými metodami a sekvenování nové generace (NGS) TruSight Tumor panel, Illumina. Na základě dosavadních analýz bylo možno aplikovat personalizovanou léčbu („biomarker driven molecularly-targeted metronomic therapy“) u přibližně 20 % případů. Od roku 2016 jsme zavedli do komplexního vyšetřovacího panelu též whole exome sequencing a transkripční profilování. Pilotní pozorování ukazují, že nejlepší léčebné odpovědi je v případě theranostického přístupu dosahováno u pacientů, u kterých jsou v souladu genomická, transkriptomická a fosfoproteomická data. Námi navrhovaný komplexní rozvoj vyšetřování nádorové tkáně u dětí s refrakterními a relabujícími solidními nádory a NHL rozšířeným panelem vyšetření (histopatologie, NGS - TruSight, NGS - whole exome sequencing, transkripční profilování, fosfoproteomické techniky) spolu s bioinformatickou podporou, povedou k prohloubení našich znalostí o molekulárním profilu nádoru a genetickém pozadí hostitele (nosičství germinálních mutací). Odůvodněně očekáváme, že navazující klinická aplikace tohoto inovativního theranostického přístupu povede k efektivnějšímu designu personalizované léčby (n=1 trials) u významného procenta dětí s refrakterními malignitami.",

   "annotation": "Sestřih RNA je jedním z klíčových kroků v expresi genetické informace, při kterém dochází k odstraňování intronů a spojování sousedících exonů. Tento proces je závislý nejen na rozeznání samotných sestřihových míst, ale i na přítomnosti exonových a intronových elementů regulujících sestřih, jejichž narušení mutacemi může výrazně ovlivnit úspěšnost sestřihu pre-mRNA do zralé mRNA. Především v oblasti diagnostiky dědičných onemocnění bývají intronové mutace opomíjeny. Cílem projektu je ověřit, v jaké míře mohou být intronové mutace zodpovědné za narušení samotného sestřihu se zaměřením na sestřih pre-mRNA genu SERPING1 a následný rozvoj hereditárního angioedému (HAE). U části pacientů trpících HAE nebyla prokázána kauzální mutace v žádném z exonů genu SERPING1, přestože byla odhalena snížená hladina proteinu v krevní plasmě. Možnými kandidáty na kauzální mutace jsou právě intronové mutace. Vzhledem k tomu, že vliv vzdálených intronových mutací není jednoznačně predikovatelný, bude vliv takovýchto mutací experimentálně ověřován. K tomu bude využito unikátní metody vyvinuté již dříve na CEITEC MU, která umožňuje sledovat vliv velkého množství mutací cílového genu v jediném experimentu pomocí sekvenování příští generace. Samotná metoda byla vyvinuta a vyzkoušena na exonových mutacích, nicméně její hlavní přednost spočívá právě v ověřování vlivu nukleotidových záměn, které nejsou zahrnuty ve výsledných transkriptech jako je tomu například u intronových mutací. Tento dosud nevyužívaný přístup k řešení dané problematiky bude vyžadovat jak vyřešení dílčích metodických specifik, tak vývoj bionformatických nástrojů pro analýzu sekvenačních dat a jejich interpretaci v kontextu rozvoje HAE u pacientů. Využití tohoto přístupu by bylu unikátní jak při řešení obecných otázek spojených se sestřihem tak při lékařské diagnostice. Spolupráce pracovišť CEITEC , LF a FI MU umožní provést rozsáhlejší analýzy vlivu intronových mutací, které nebyly dříve možné, jak v kontextu reálné diagnostiky HAE, tak s ohledem na obecné znalosti týkající se intronových regulátorů sestřihu.",

Klíčovým faktorem tohoto procesu je vznik RAD51 nukleoproteinového vlákna, které je schopno vyhledat homologní DNA a zprostředkovat její zkopírování. K zajištění včasného a správného dokončení tohoto procesu musí být HR regulována. Mezi její regulátory patři i DNA helikázy, které chrání genom před aberantní HR tím, že jsou schopny rozložit RAD51 vlákno, případně i další rekombinační meziprodukty. Nicméně jak tyto regulátory fungují na molekulární úrovni je velmi málo známo. V rámci tohoto projektu využijeme revoluční technologie studia biochemických porcesů v reálném čase a to jak ve směsi, tak na jednomolekulové úrovni. Určení mechanismu regulace HR zlepší naše chápání molekulární podstaty karcinogeneze a může představovat unikátní možnost pro terapeutické využití.",

Časná diagnostika poruch paměti toto riziko významně sníží.\nNově se objevující druhy léčiv s sebou sice přinášejí naději na úspěšnější řešení různých chorobných stavů, klinická zkoušení léků však často pacienty vyššího věku multimorbidní a se sníženou soběstačnosti nezahrnují. Proto je důležité věnovat pozornost případným novým komplikacím spojeným se zavedením nového léčiva - v poslední době konkrétně skupiny nových orálních antikoagulancií.\nNadále bude věnována pozornost preventivním aktivitám podporujícím úspěšné stárnutí a předcházejícím ztrátě soběstačnosti seniorů.

Je zaměřen na deficity v tvorbě protilátek a dysregulaci v komplementovém systému – jmenovitě u deficitu C1-INH – hereditárního angioedému (HAE). \nV oblasti HAE budeme pokračovat ve sledování významu a rozsahu aktivace granulocytů v klidovém období i v době ataky. Dále budeme sledovat některé klinické aspekty tohoto onemocnění, zejména možnosti léčby HAE v těhotenství (Dr. R. Hakl, Dr. E.

Zároveň budeme pokračovat v analýze oblastí genu SERPING1, které mají význam pro regulaci sestřihu mRNA a expresi C1 inhibitoru. (Mgr. T.

Zároveň plánujeme i střevní mykobiom (složení hub) pomocí molekulárních metod – zejména metody fragmentační analýzy. Pacienti s těmito diagnózami postrádají klíčovou slizniční protilátku IgA. Absence IgA protilátek může hrát roli ve vzniku infekcí a jiných enteropatií, ke kterým jsou pacienti s CVID velmi náchylní. Zároveň u těchto pacientů předpokládáme zvýšený výskyt střevní dysmikrobie (Mgr. K. Fiedorová). V návaznosti na tuto část projektu se budeme zabývat možnostmi detekce bakterií a hub v polymikrobiálních klinických vzorcích (Mgr.

Tento projekt rozšíří nabídku již fungujícího vědeckého výukového centra.  Půjde o sérii praktických laboratorních pokusů, jejichž náplní bude seznámit účastníky se zajímavostmi z fascinujícího světa botaniky. Úvodem všichni účastníci obdrží laboratorní protokol, který bude obsahovat podrobný popis všech pokusů, které si během kurzu sami vyzkouší a kam si budou zaznamenávat své výsledky. Účastníci vytvoří 6 týmů (3-5 osob/tým), které budou společně řešit zadané úkoly.  Během kurzu se účastníci dozvědí o složení a struktuře rostlin, naučí se, jak pracovat s mikroskopem, zkusí si vyrobit vlastní rostlinný preparát, následně si jej prohlédnou pod mikroskopem či stereomikroskopem a dozví se spoustu dalších zajímavostí.

MikroRNA (miRNA) jsou nedávno identifikované molekuly RNA, které se uplatňují jako zásadní intracelulární mediátory procesů, které se účastní adaptace na pohybovou aktivitu, včetně angiogeneze, zánětu, mitochondriálního metabolismu, tvorby kontraktilní síly v srdečním/kosterním svalů a svalové hypertrofie. I když cirkulující molekuly miRNA (c-miRNA) byly studovány jako biomarkery u řady onemocnění, chybějí údaje definující úlohu c-miRNA v podmínkách akutní tréninkové zátěže i dlouhodobého tréninku u zdravých osob a u populace seniorů je množství poznatků velmi malé. K dispozici je také jen malé množství informací o korelaci mezi c-miRNA a expresí miRNA v moči u seniorů.

Hlavním cílem projektu je, díky interdisciplinárnímu přístupu a unikátnímu technickému vybavení, zásadně přispět k poznání humánní magnetorecepce. Projekt staví na dvou aktuálních faktech: 1) fenomén humánní magnetorecepce se dostal na úroveň, kdy může navázat na pevně zakotvenou metodickou i vědomostní základnu vybudovanou studiem živočišné magnetorecepce, na které má skupina navrhovatele podíl. 2) pokrok neurověd umožňuje díky novým nástrojům odhalit neurální podstatu dříve pouze empiricky známých psychogenních, paranormálních či jiných fenoménů, dosavadními metodami nevysvětlitelných (např. fenomén déja-vu popsaný pracovníky Neurověd). Z nich vychází plán spolupráce 5 subjektů z MU dávající ojedinělou a originální kombinaci metod a přístupů.\nBiologie (UEBPř.fak.) má největší zkušenosti s výzkumem magnetorecepce u živočichů a disponuje vyspělou metodologií pro její studium, m.j. odstíněnou komorou umožňující simulovat libovolný přirozený magnetický vektor. Geofyzika (UGVPř.fak.) je schopna fyzikálně přesně definovat terénní anomálie magnetického pole a provést experimenty s reakcí velké skupiny pokusných osob. Neurovědy (CEITEC a LF) jsou schopny pomocí sledování behaviorálních, motorických i elektrofyziologických charakteristik pozitivních respondentů v laboratoři přiblížit jak mechanismus recepce tak i zapojení struktur mozku. Pomocí 3T NMR může zjišťovat možné anatomické odchylky a funkční, efektivní konektivitu mezi vybranými mozkovými oblastmi. Pracoviště FSS zajistí kontrolu psychologických faktorů nutně doprovázejících výzkum humánní magnetorecepce, jejíž absence mohla mít zásadní vliv na heterogennost výsledků předešlých studií. Integrální zpracování a intepretace heterogenních dat, kontrola experimentálního designu, i následné zpracování dat je v projektu řešeno ve spolupráci s bioinformatiky IBA. \nPozitivní nález a popis humánní magnetorecepce by byl zásadním impulzem pro otevírající se novou oblast smyslové a nervové fyziologie člověka. Pro společenský význam tématu, kvalitně metodicky zvládnutá studie může poskytnout cenné a dobře publikovatelné informace i v případě negativních nálezů. To zajistí možnost ucházet se o projekty, pro které by byla první, zjišťovací fáze výzkumu příliš riskantní.",

Perspektivním přístupem při terapii nádorových onemocnění se zdá být enkapsulace již ověřených chemoterapeutik za pomocí kavitandů jako jsou cucurbit[n]urily, resp. vhodných nanomateriálů. Slibnou alternativou k tomuto postupu je rovněž využití látek založených na PtIV případně na neplatinových kovech (např. ruthenium). Látky založené na PtIV vykazují obecně nižší reaktivitu v porovnání s klasickými platinovými cytostatiky. Projekt je postaven na hypotéze, že lze za pomoci racionálního designu kavitandů (přenašečů) a promyšlených modifikací platinových (PtIV) a rutheniových (RuIII) léčiv dosáhnout výrazné redukce toxicity na nenádorové tkáně a zlepšit cílení jejich účinku v porovnání s běžně užívanými chemoterapeutiky. V tomto projektu bude porovnána účinnost a mechanismus cytostatik konvenčně užívaných k léčbě daných onemocnění prostaty (docetaxel), prsu (doxorubicin), a kolorekta (deriváty cisplatiny) (a) s nově syntetizovanými léčivy na bázi platinyIV a rutheniaIII, (b) s konvenčními léčivy enkapsulovanými do kavitandů, (c) s nově syntetizovanými deriváty enkapsulovanými do kavitandů a (d) kavitandů modifikovaných pro další cílení léčiv. Práce si tak klade následující cíle: (1) design, příprava a charakterizace nových modifikací platinových a rutheniových léčiv a supramolekulárních komplexů nových i existujících chemoterapeutik s kavitandy jako jsou cucurbiturily, cyklodextriny, calixareny, (2) Porovnání cytotoxického účinku nových derivátů platinových a rutheniových léčiv oproti léčivům rutinně užívaným k léčbě karcinomů prsu, prostaty a kolorekta v in vitro experimentech, (3) Detailní charakterizace vlivu nových platinových a rutheniových derivátů na výše uvedené nádorové buněčné linie – analýza genové exprese na úrovni mRNA a proteinu, analýza změny buněčných procesů a buněčných smrtí, analýza změny metalomu v buňkách (distribuce platiny a ruthenia a dalších kovů – zinek, měď, železo aj.), (4) Ověření in-vitro experimentů na in-vivo myších modelech po indukci nádorů kolorekta, prsu a prostaty. Využity budou metody laserové ablace s hmotnostní spektrometrií indukčně vázaného plazmatu, ale také konfokální mikroskopie.",

Z naměřených dat bude provedena typologie chůze a došlapu a bude vytvořena intervalová norma optimální chůze a rozložení plantárních tlaků při chůzi. Intervaly normy budou reflektovat zejména věkové a somatické parametry. Typologie došlapu bude vycházet z hodnocení časového průběhu plantárních tlaků a sil působících při došlapu. Dalším krokem výzkumu pak bude aplikace skórovacích systémů do procesu hodnocení chůze a klenby nohy u specifických skupin populace. Posledním krokem projektu pak bude přesný a komplexní popis experimentálně ověřené metody aplikace vytvořené normy při hodnocení chůze a klenby nohy pro výzkumné aplikace. Po vytvoření metodiky srovnávání vybraných parametrů chůze proběhne zpracování podkladů pro publikování stěžejních zjištění na mezinárodní konferenci a v impaktovaném periodiku Research quarterly, nebo obdobném.",

   "annotation": "Od sedmdesátých let minulého století se technologický pokrok stává ve světě hlavním faktorem růstu nákladů na poskytování zdravotní péče. Potřeba a zájem vytvářet a uplatňovat v medicíně inovativní moderní postupy naráží stále více na omezenost zdrojů. To vedlo a stále vede k hledání a zlepšování nástrojů podporujících racionální \na objektivní rozhodování o těchto, většinou veřejných, finančních zdrojích v zájmu zajištění kvalitní péče při zachování principu rovného a spravedlivého přístupu. Hodnocení zdravotnických technologií (HTA) je jedním z takových nástrojů. Hledání rovnováhy mezi ekonomickými pohledy a modely, snahou zastavit nárůst výdajů a zachováním dostupnosti intervencí spolu s novými etickými výzvami, jež přináší personalizovaná medicína, je proces složitý. Naprosto zásadní je pak provádění těchto hodnocení dle propracovaných a standardizovaných metodik, jež na národní úrovni v této chvíli absentují. Jedním z navrhovaných pilířů a cílů projektu je tedy metodicky orientovaný výzkum s vypracováním návrhu adekvátní metodiky, které bude zohledňovat evropské standardy i národní specifika. Základním předpokladem úspěšné implementace a realizace HTA je pak dostupnost potřebných dat, a to nejen strukturovaných dat klinických, ale i dat vztahujících se k hodnocení nákladů péče. Dalším cílem projektu je tedy mapování dostupnosti a datové základny pro oblast HTA, a to modelově na příkladu péče o diabetické pacienty. Diabetes je celospolečensky závažné onemocnění, které má kromě medicínských aspektů léčby i významné ekonomické a sociální dopady. Náklady na léčbu těchto jsou čerpány jednak ze zdravotního pojištění, současně však mají nezanedbatelný finanční dopad i v oblasti sociální. Pouze část těchto nákladů představují náklady na primární léčbu, větší část financí je čerpána na léčbu chronických komplikací. Z těchto důvodů byl vybrán segment diabetické péče pro modelové zpracování v rámci tohoto projektu, přičemž finálně předpokládáme, jako poslední pilíř projektu, vytvoření HTA analýzy pro vybranou skupinu diabetických pacientů, a to dle vypracované metodiky a s využitím strukturované datové základny.",

   "annotation": "Kardiovaskulární onemocnění jsou nejčastější příčinou úmrtí v rozvinutém světě. Ve velké většině zahrnují jejich projevy srdeční selhání. Výzkum procesu selhání mechanické srdeční funkce na buněčné a molekulární úrovni lze sledovat a modelovat již na jednotlivých srdečních buňkách. Kardiomyocyty lze bez zásahu do srdeční tkáně získat diferenciací z indukovaných pluripotentních kmenových buněk (iPS). Srdeční buňky tak vyrůstají a tepají v laboratorní misce, stačí malý kousek kůže dárce. Pokud je dárcem člověk s dědičným onemocněním srdce, lze u jeho srdečních buněk sledovat mechanické a elektrické projevy.\nRůst na běžných površích však nedovoluje iPS-kardiomyocytům volné kontrakce a omezuje jejich plnohodnotné zrání. Špatná biologická odpověď srdečních buněk se projevuje jejich přeměnou ve vazivo (fibroblasty) a ztrátou mechanické funkce. \nPrimárním cílem práce je nalézt takový substrát, který by neomezoval kontraktilitu, zamezil přeměně a podporoval kardiomyocyty v růstu. Toho je možné dosáhnout pomocí nových nanomateriálů založených na bázi biopolymerů. Tyto materiály mají díky svému polymernímu základu a vysoké porositě výbornou elasticitu. Podporují tak růst dospělých srdečních buněk v animálním modelu. \nZároveň je potřeba povrch upravit tak, aby co nejvíce připomínal vznikající srdeční tkáň. Modifikaci povrchu lze provést plasmochemicky, na povrch působí speciální druh nízkoteplotního elektrického plazmatu. Na ošetřených površích lze generovat funkční chemické skupiny, které zajistí hledanou biokompatabilitu. Plasmochemické reakce jsou pro vyšší efektivitu často kombinovány s klasickými chemickými reakcemi. Dalším cílem práce je adaptace povrchu substrátu tak, aby podporoval specializaci, růst, zrání a mechanickou funkci iPS-kardiomyocytů.\nTřetím dílčím cílem je kultivace kardiomyocytů v zátěžových podmínkách (pod vlivem farmak a mechanického stresu) a sledování změn jejich funkčních vlastností. Na úrovni jednotlivých buněk lze kontrakce popsat s pomocí mikroskopie atomárních sil (AFM). Metodami molekulární biologie lze popsat změny strukturálních vlastnosti buněk a jejich metabolismu. Na úrovni jednotlivých kardiomyocytů tak můžeme sledovat mechanismy zapříčiňující v organismu srdeční selhání a hledat pro jeho terapii nová léčiva a terapeutické postupy.",

Vycházíme z předpokladu, že představy o důstojném umírání se ne vždy potkávají s žitou realitou. Závěrem života se rozumí období během posledního roku života pacienta/jednotlivce, který stoná nevyléčitelnou nemocí a/nebo umírá na stáří, - tj. o svém blížícím se konci života ví a vědomě se na něj (ne)připravuje. Jedná se o téma vysoce aktuální a univerzální, dotýkající se každého z nás, zároveň však v naší kultuře téma velmi citlivé až tabuizované, o kterém se veřejně nemluví. Pro zpracování výzkumného záměru se v konsorciu sešly FSS MU, LF MU a ESF MU. Zvolená metodologie je multiparadigmatická. Kvalitativní tým shromáždí výzkumný vzorek 150 rozhovorů s osobami v závěru života, jejich rodinami a zdravotním personálem, realizuje zúčastněné pozorování místa závěru života (nemocnice, hospicy, domov) a připraví obsahovou analýzu sekundárních dat dostupných z veřejných portálů a publikací Ministerstva zdravotnictví ČR a vybraných zdravotních pojišťoven s cílem popsat představy o důstojnosti v závěru života z pohledu jednotlivce, jeho pečující rodiny/příbuzných a zdravotnického/pečujícího personálu. Kvalitativní tým provede analýzu unikátních a zatím sociální vědou nezpracovaných dat z databáze Ústavu zdravotnických informací a statistiky (UZIS) s cílem zaměřit se na informace o ekonomické náročnosti posledního roku života umírajícího, jakož i politických rozhodnutích stojících v pozadí realizovaných výdajů. Tím představí státní politiku důstojného závěru života. Hlavním výstupem výzkumu bude společná monografie, která významnou a ve své ucelenosti jedinečnou měrou přispěje k poučené akademické, společenské, ekonomické i politické debatě o umírání v současné České republice.",

   "annotation": "Snaha zásadně zpřehlednit a standardizovat strukturu výuky patří k dlouhodobým prioritám LF MU. V uplynulých třech letech byl úspěšně realizován projekt OPTIMED s cílem plošně inovovat studijní program Všeobecného lékařství a významně tak posílit výuku orientovanou na řešení problémů v souladu s uplatněním absolventa v jeho další klinické nebo akademické praxi. V rámci projektu OPTIMED vznikla unikátní ICT platforma prezentující popis medicínského kurikula založená na metodice tzv. výstupů z učení. Předkládaný projekt EVAMED přímo navazuje na úspěšný projekt OPTIMED a přispěje tak dílčím způsobem k jeho udržitelnosti. EVAMED se ovšem zaměřuje hlavně na ICT technologie, pokročilou analýzu a vizualizaci dat, přičemž databázi OPTIMED chápe jako bohatý zdroj heterogenních dat. S ohledem na fakt, že na přípravě popisu výuky se podílelo více než 400 výukových specialistů a garantů je zřejmé, že granularita napříč obsahem portálu vykazuje vysokou variabilitu. Přirozená míra subjektivity autora-pedagoga při formulaci výstupů z učení i při specifikaci dalších popisných atributů studia rozdělila obsah portálu do různě formulovaných komponent – od obecných až po velmi detailně zaměřených. Primárním cílem projektu EVAMED je ve spolupráci se dvěma pracovními skupinami identifikovat prostřednictvím nově navržených metrik oblasti, které jsou ve své formalizaci nekonzistentní. S využitím nově vyvinutých evaluačních přístupů a metod pro vytěžování dat bude v navazujícím kroku možné efektivně zprostředkovat jasně uchopitelné výstupy autorům ve formě doporučení generovaných od zástupců pracovní skupiny. Hlavní snahou je tedy využít moderní přístupy k analýze heterogenních datových zdrojů za účelem sjednocení obsahu databáze OPTIMED, což povede ke zvýšení kvality popisu celého kurikula. Navržené a implementované metody hodnocení kvality a pro analýzu a vizualizaci dat mají vzhledem ke své unikátnosti velký publikační a citační potenciál, a to bez ohledu na konkrétní pilotní implementaci nad databází OPTIMED. Předpokládané výstupy z předloženého projektu EVAMED směřují k šíření know-how v oblasti optimalizace medicínského kurikula a vytěžování dat z edukačně zaměřených databází (EDM – educational data mining), a to nejen v prostředí lékařských fakult ČR a SR, ale také na mezinárodní úrovni. EDM představuje v dnešní době pro vzdělávání totéž co bioinformatika pro biologii.",

Mutace v genu RECQ4 jsou spojeny s velmi závažným onemocněním Rothmund-Thomsonovým syndromem (RTS). RTS je autozomálně recesivní onemocnění, jehož klinickými příznaky jsou červená vyrážka (poikiloderma), oční zákal, kosterní defekty a vyšší náchylnost k rakovině kůže a kostí.  Avšak přesná role proteinu RECQ4 v metabolismu DNA zůstává dosud neobjasněna. Nicméně celá řada publikací ukazuje, že RECQ4 hraje velmi důležitou roli při udržování stability genetické informace a zároveň se podílí na její opravě. Výsledky z našeho laboratorního pracoviště naznačují, že RECQ4 protein by pravděpodobně mohl zastávat úlohu během rozkládání replikačních/rekombinačních meziproduktů, což je zásadní pro správnou segregaci chromozomů v průběhu mitózy, která je nesmírně důležitá pro další vývoj a život buňky. Naše studie tak přispěje k pochopení úlohy proteinu RECQ4 při nestabilitě genomu.",

O zbývajících 20-30% hovoříme jako o epilepsiích farmakorezistentních. Farmakorezistenci lze (nikoliv dogmaticky) definovat jako nedosažení dlouhodobé bezzáchvatovosti za pomoci dvou dobře tolerovaných a vhodně zvolených antiepileptik (1). V takovém případě mají být vždy zváženy jiné (=nefarmakologické) terapeutické modality - v první řadě resekční epileptochirurgický výkon, v druhé řadě stimulace vagového nervu (VNS) a ketogenní dieta (KD). Právě KD zaznamenává v posledních letech významný rozmach v klinické praxi i vědecké sféře. Základní principy léčby jsou celosvětově prakticky totožné. Konkrétní léčebné protokoly se však v závislosti na pracovišti značně různí, a to zejména ve snaze o dosažení nejen maximální účinnosti, ale také maximální bezpečnosti léčby. Hlavním cílem projektu je proto porovnání efektivity ketogenní diety v závislosti na zvoleném iniciačním protokolu - s úvodním hladověním (fasting) versus bez úvodního hladovění (non-fasting).",

Jedním z nich je i roztroušená skleróza (RS), v otázce diagnostiky tohoto onemocnění má dle dostupných údajů tato technika velký potenciál.  Analýza dat DTI zobrazení je obecně poměrně nesnadná, vyžaduje nejrůznější sofistikované postupy softwarového zpracování.  Zatímco v případě DTI zobrazení mozku existují již poměrně robustní a standardizované metodické postupy, otázka analýzy DTI dat míchy není uspokojivě vyřešena a je proto otevřená inovativním přístupům. Cílem tohoto projektu je vyvinout semiautomatickou metodu měření parametrů DTI zobrazení krční míchy s využitím konvenčních obrazů MR zobrazení se segmentací jednotlivých strukturálních komponent míchy. Tyto algorytmy budou testovány na MR datech skupiny zdravých dobrovolníků, provedená měření budou porovnána s obvyklými manuálními technikami měření. V druhé fázi tohoto projektu budou vyvinuté metody použity pro analýzu DTI dat skupiny pacientů s klinicky izolovaným sydromem a s roztroušenou sklerózou s cílem porovnat parametry DTI zobrazení krční míchy jednotlivých podskupin pacientů se zdravými dobrovolníky a zmapovat tak míru strukturálního poškození bílé a šedé hmoty míchy v počátečním stádiu demyelinizačního onemocnění.

Projekt bude realizován v prostředí II. chirurgické kliniky Fakultní nemocnice u sv. Anny v Brně (dále jen FNUSA). Realizace projektu má vést k zavedení termovizní techniky do oblasti vyšetření diabetických i nediabetických pacientů, v tomto konkrétním případě zejména s ohledem na prováděné ravaskularizační zákroky na pracovišti II. chirurgické kliniky FNUSA. Specifita projektu je dána přímou spoluprací klinického a teoretického pracoviště, kdy je diagnóza pacienta stanovena několika metodami. Unikátním je právě propojení termografických zařízení se stanovením transkutánní tenze kyslíku (TcpO2) a hodnoty ABI. Aktuálnost tohoto tématu dokazují statistické údaje, vykazující vzrůstající trend výskytu diabetes mellitus a s ním i následných komplikací, včetně postižení periferního cévního řečiště.

Zcela zásadní z pohledu snížení rizik vyplývajících z polymorbidity je medikace v seniorském věku - její optimalizace a zejména časný záchyt vznikající poruchy kognice, která může zvláště u samostatně žijícího seniory způsobit závažené chyby v medikaci s následnými opakovanými hospitalizacemi.",

Hlavním cílem současného projektu je studium prostupnosti hemato-likvorové bariéry v plexus choroideus laterální a třetí mozkové komory po chronickém poškození periferního nervu.  \nNa experimentálních modelech neuropatické bolesti laboratorního potkana bylo zjištěno, že v průběhu Wallerovy degenerace vznikají signální molekuly, které spouští zánětové reakce ve spinálních gangliích. Ty se projevují aktivací satelitních gliových buněk, invazí aktivovaných makrofágů a expresí pro- a protizánětlivých cytokinů a jejich receptorů nejen ve spinálních gangliích souvisejících s poškozeným nervem, ale i ve strukturách vzdálených segmentů. Šíření zánětové reakce do spinálních ganglií vzdálených míšních segmentů může probíhat krevní a/nebo likvorovou cestou. Naše dřívější experimenty prokázaly průnik značeného dextranu z likvoru a krve do spinálního ganglia, což prokazuje prostupnost hemato-nervové a likvor-nervové bariéry pro molekuly velikosti cytokinů (Joukal et al., 2013, 2014). \nPředpokládáme, že přes porušenou hemato-nervovou bariéru distálního pahýlu poškozeného nervu prostoupí signální molekuly do krevního oběhu a současně přes změněnou hemato-likvorovou bariéru do likvoru a tím ke vzdáleným strukturám nervové soustavy. Předpokládáme rovněž, že buňky plexus choroideus mohou po poškození periferního nervu reagovat produkcí dalších zánětových mediátorů sloužících k chemotaxi imunitních buněk a tím přispívat k šíření zánětové reakce do vyšších etáží centrální nervové soustavy.\nExperimenty budou provedeny na 30 potkanech linie Wistar (samci, 250-300 g). Po provedení chronické konstrikce nervu budou zvířata přežívat 3 a 21 dnů. Následně bude intravenózně aplikován tracer (Floro-Emerald, MW=10 000). Po 18 hodinách bude odebrán mozek společně s mozkovým kmenem. Na kryostatových  řezech mozkových komor s plexus choroideus budou imunohistochemicky detekovány prozánětlivé cytokiny TNF-alpha, Il-6 a antigen prezentující buňky protilátkou MHC II. Buněčné spoje budou vizualizovány protilátkami proti ocludinu a claudinu. Získané preparáty budou vyhodnoceny ve fluorescenčním a konfokálním mikroskopu a intenzita imunofluorescence bude kvantifikována a statisticky srovnána s kontrolní skupinou zvířat (naivní) a se zvířaty po kožní incizi, ale bez poškození nervu (sham).",

This field, which includes chronic and acute tumors (leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myeloproliferative disorders), is already moving towards personalised diagnostic approaches and individualised (experimental) therapeutic strategies. Indeed, the current “path to cure” applied by a significant number of European haematologists includes: i) personalised diagnostics, ii) tailored therapies, iii) monitoring of treatment response, iv) home health care, v) evaluation of long lasting responses and the side effects of long term therapy. All the above suggest that onco-hematology epresents a unique opportunity in which to assess the sustainability and harmonization of a personalised medicine model in Europe.",

V předchozích třech letech byl proveden rozsáhlý průzkum zaměřený na proces hodnocení nehojících se ran v klinické praxi (v zařízeních akutní lůžkové péče, domácí péče a pracovišť sociálních služeb).    Na základě analýzy výstupů předchozích projektů byly odhaleny nedostatky nejen v hodnocení nehojících se ran, ale zejména v nedostatečné erudici nelékařských zdravotnických pracovníků v přímé péči ve wound managementu a v identifikaci typu nehojící se rány (diferenciace dekubitu a inkontinenční dermatitis) a riziku sorrorigenního postižení. V rámci projektů SVK tak již byla posuzována kvalita péče o osoby s nehojící se ránou a navazující projekt by měl umožnit další zvyšování kvality péče s využitím zahraničních guidelines a jejich implementace v klinické praxi. Jedná se o intervenční projekt. Projektové aktivity navazují na odbornou činnost navrhovatelky projektu (členka výboru České společnosti pro léčbu ran - ČSLR, členka výboru European Wound Management Association - EWMA). Cílem projektu je zlepšení odborných kompetencí profesionálních pečujících ve wound managementu. Projekt je koncipován jako multidimenzionální, s propojením specifických oblastí wound managementu – prevenci, diagnostiku a léčbu nehojících se ran s rizikem sorrorigenie.

Mění se také pohled na léčbu nehojících se ran a tak i dekubitů a IAD. Základem procesu efektivní péče je správné stanovení diagnózy a vhodné léčby – pojmenování a epidemiologické zhodnocení fenoménu (odlišení tlakových lézí a kontaktních dermatitid). Na základě projektových aktivit bude možné získat relevantní data, provést klinické a populační (epidemiologické) zhodnocení v konkrétním zdravotnickém zařízení, naplánovat a realizovat edukační aktivity pro zdravotníky v přímé péči.",

Nejčastějším typem anizometropie je anizometropie myopická, která se vyskytuje ve 40 % případů. Anizometropie o velikosti minimálně 2 D se vyskytuje minimálně u 20 % pacientů s refrakční vadou. Anizometropie o velikosti 2,5 D, tedy stav, kdy velikost retinálních obrazů se liší o 5 %, je obvykle hranicí pro binokulární vidění. Aniseikonie je spojena s anizometropií. Je to stav, kdy obraz předmětu vnímaného pravým a levým okem má nestejnou velikost a tvar. Při iseikonii jsou obrazy obou očí zcela shodné. Iseikonii můžeme dělit na dynamickou a statickou. Příčiny aniseikonie jsou optické a neoptické. Optické příčiny můžeme dělit na přirozené a uměle vyvolané. Mezi uměle vyvolané typy aniseikonie patří brýlová aniseikonie. Hlavním projevem aniseikonie je porucha binokulárního vidění.",

Za tímto účelem využíváme několika přístupů, a to: i) ověřování a zpřesňování znalostí o mechanizmech účinku psychofarmak a identifikace jejich nežádoucích účinků (farmakodynamický přístup), ii) studium farmakokinetických vlastností psychofarmak (farmakokinetický přístup) a iii) studium dědičně podmíněné variability odpovědi organismu na podávání léčiv včetně možného epigenetického ovlivnění buněk v oboru cílené terapie v onkologii (farmakogenetický přístup). \nFarmakodynamické studie se soustřeďují především na identifikaci nových psychofarmak s antidepresivním, anxiolytickým a antipsychotickým potenciálem. Do skupiny studovaných léčiv patří kromě jiných ketamin jako potenciální rychle působící antidepresivum. Slibným zdrojem pro vývoj nových antipsychotik je endokanabinoidní systém v mozku, který ovlivňuje další neurotransmiterové systémy, např. dopaminergní, serotonergní, glutamátergní. Mezi studované nežádoucí účinky patří především vliv antipsychotik, ale i schizofrenii podobného fenotypu (animální modely), na rozvoj metabolického syndromu a hladiny adipokinů.\nFarmakokinetické studie se zaměřují na aktivitu jednoho z nejdůležitějších biotransformačních enzymatických systémů, cytochromu P450 (CYP). Metabolická aktivita CYP je ovlivněna mnoha faktory, jako jsou pohlaví, věk, genetický polymorfismus a xenobiotika. Interindividuální rozdíly v aktivitě CYP, způsobují odlišnou rychlost metabolizace léčiv mezi jednotlivými pacienty a mohou hrát významnou roli v bezpečnosti a účinnosti podávaných látek. Stanovení vlivu používaných i potenciálních léčiv na aktivitu tohoto metabolického systému je nezbytné pro dosažení bezpečné a účinné farmakoterapie. Farmakogenetické studie se soustředí na hledání souvislostí mezi variabilitou odpovědi na cílená protinádorová léčiva a expresí vybraných biomarkerů. Tyto jsou studovány především na úrovni epigenetických mechanismů (mikroRNA), které regulují jejich expresi. Změny v expresi mikroRNA jsou zkoumány také v kontextu možného farmakologického ovlivnění. Hlavními cíli celého projektu je přispět k výzkumu a vývoji nových léčiv a zlepšit stávající klinické rozhodování v indikacích nákladné cílené terapie.

   "annotation": "Pro nádory prostaty je typické významné snížení hladin zinečnatých iontů (Zn2+). Toto snížení je významným patogenetickým mechanismem podporujícím invazivitu a růst nádorových buněk. Snížení hladin je způsobeno snížením exprese transportních mechanismů pro Zn2+, a proto pouhá suplementace ke zvýšení hladin nepovede. Poznatky z literatury poukazují na fakt, že opětovné zvýšení hladin Zn2+ snižuje metastatický potenciál. Cílem projektu je (1) za pomocí nanotechnologií syntetizovat Zn2+ enkapsulované do lipozomálních partikulí (LIP) a využít tohoto nosiče k efektivnějšímu zvýšení hladin Zn2+ v buňkách, (2) porovnání účinku Zn2+ a LIP-Zn2+ na invazivitu a migraci buněk a na expresi genů spojenou s agresívním fenotypem in vitro, (3) in-vivo otestování LIP-Zn2+ jako neoadjuvans s docetaxelem.",

   "annotation": "V posledních letech bylo dosaženo značného pokroku v pochopení mechanismů přeprogramování metabolismu nádorové buňky, zejména Warburgova efektu, tj. přepnutí metabolismu glukózy na aerobní glykolýzu. Současně dochází k nárůstu konzumace fruktózy, což s sebou nese negativní následky, mj. ve formě poškození jater, jež jsou hlavním orgánem zodpovědným za přeměnu fruktózy. Většina ostatních tkání nemá transportní proteiny pro příjem fruktózy a jsou proto závislé na glukóze. Ukazuje se, že i některé nádory dokáží metabolizovat fruktózu, ale v oblasti léčby a diagnostiky se toho zatím nedaří využít. Cílem předkládaného projektu je ověření výsledků naznačujících že buňky melanomu jsou schopny využívat fruktózu jako alternativní zdroj energie a nalezení cest k využití tohoto poznatku v terapii.",

Jako příklad lze uvést délku a rychlost dráhy pohybů pracovních nástrojů,koordinaci zorného pole kamery s pracovními nástroji, learning curve a mnohé další, které jsou následně vyhodnocovány.

Cílem tohoto projektu je vytvořit nový, vysoce spolehlivý a účinný molekulární typovací systém, umožňující sledovat genetickou diverzitu a mapovat výskyt treponemálních kmenů v celosvětovém měřítku. Rozlišovací schopnost nového typovacího systému bude testována na geneticky odlišných klinických izolátech a vzorcích pocházejících z různých míst světa. Získaná epidemiologická data umožní sledovat cesty přenosu syfilis v České republice (ČR), identifikovat rizikové skupiny obyvatel a pomoci při eliminaci tohoto onemocnění. Současně s molekulární typizací klinických izolátů bude monitorován výskyt makrolid-rezistentních kmenů na území ČR důležité z hlediska doporučení antibiotické terapie u pacientů s alergií na penicilin.",

Aktivace granulocytů tak může být nejen přímým následkem interakce makroorganismu s mikrobem, ale také výsledkem řady imunopatologických stavů, na nichž se primárně mikrobiální podnět může, ale i nemusí podílet. Mezi tyto imunopatologické stavy můžeme zařadit i primární imunodeficience a to primární hypogamaglobulinémie a hereditární angioedém.\nTypickými zástupci onemocnění primární hypogamaglobulinémií je běžený variabilní imunodeficit (CVID). Je důležité, že u pacientů s CVID jsou přítomny serologické známky možné bakteriální translokace vyjádřené vzestupem sérové hladiny sCD14, stejně jako sCD25, vyjadřujícího především možnou aktivaci monocytů a T-lymfocytů. To vše nás vede k otázce o stupni aktivace granulocytů u nemocných s CVID a šířeji s vrozenými agamaglobulinémiemi.\nKromě aktivace granulocytů je u pacientů s CVID možné vystopovat možné známky supresorové aktivity granulocytů a monocytů. Ta je asociována s nově popsanou subpopulací  granulocyte-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSC) a monocyte-myeloid-derived suppressor (MO-MDSC). \nDalším onemocněním ze skupiny primárních imunodeficiencí, kde leze předpokládat aktivaci granulocytů je hereditární angioedém. Podstatou tohoto onemocnění je kvantitativní nebo kvalitativní porucha inhibitoru C1 (C1-INH). Nedostatek tohoto regulačního proteinu vede k neregulované aktivaci nejen komplementové kaskády, ale i hemokoagulačního, fibrinolytického a kininového systému. Řada produktů všech těchto systémů má také aktivační vliv na polymorfonukleární  i monocytární buňky. \nPracovní hypotéza: \nAktivace granulocytů je přítomna u nemocných se závažnými protilátkovými imunodeficity stejně jako u nemocných s hereditárním angioedémem. Aktivce granulocytů u nemocných s CVID se spolupodílí na vzniku imunopatologických fenoménů, zejména na vzniku sekundárního imunodeficitu v oblasti T-lymfocytů.    \nStanovit stupeň aktivace granulocytů a monocytů u nemocných s CVID a HAE, jak ve „klidovém“ stavu, tak po podání intravenózní  imunoglobulinové léčby (u nemocných s CVID), nebo při atace HAE.",

   "annotation": "Regenerativní medicína a tkáňové inženýrství založené na kmenových buňkách (KB) je rychle se rozvíjející odvětví biomedicíny, v němž se kombinuje úsilí biologů, odborníků na materiály, lékařů, zákonodárců a  relevantního průmyslu, a které nabízí unikátní způsob efektivní léčby u řady onemocnění. Komplexnost výzkumu KB a vývoje jejich biomedicínských aplikací  tak navozuje potřebu koordinovaného postupu na jednotící expertní platformě. Takové platformy, virtuální či fyzické, již léta existují ve většině evropských zemí, v České republice však taková platforma chybí. Tento fakt představuje zásadní překážku pro progres v tomto vysoce důležitém interdisciplinárním odvětví v České republice. Touto absencí je navíc Česká republika diskvalifikována při účasti na mezinárodních výzkumných projektech i při přístupu k mezinárodní finanční podpoře. Abychom překonali tato závažná omezení, navrhujeme vytvořit a dlohodobě rozvíjet jedinečnou výzkumnou infrastrukturu - „Infrastruktura pro využití kmenových buněk v biomedicíně“ (InfraStem). Tato výzkumná infrastruktura (VI) bude primárně postavena na zkušenostech a zdrojích získaných mnohaletým vývojem ve třech významných vědeckých institucích v České republice: Ústavem experimentální medicíny AV ČR (Praha), Lékařskou fakultou Masarykovy Univerzity (Brno) a 2. Lékařskou fakultou Karlovy Univerzity (Praha). Přístrojové vybavení, buněčné zdroje a veškeré znalosti budou k dispozici prostředníctvím této VI širokému spektru uživatelů, od biologů, přes zákonodárce až po biotechnologický průmysl. Klíčovými pozitivy, které tato VI přinese budou zejména: i) efektivnější využití inovačního potenciálu a lidských zdrojů výzkumných týmů a institucí, které povede ke zvýšení konkurenceschopnosti ve všech oblastech aplikace KB, ii) posílení interdisciplinárního výzkumu propojením různých odvětví, jako jsou například biologie KB, bio-/nanomateriály a pokročilé zobrazovací metody, iii) vytvoření prostředí stimulujícího vytváření vědeckovýzkumných sítí, prostřednictvím společného přístupu k unikátním přístrojům, metodologiím, kozultacím a vědecké výchově, iv) posílení spolupráce s partnery z aplikační sféry jako jsou nemocnice či malé a středně velké firmy, v) zvýšení kvality víceúrovňového vzdělávání s pozitivním vlivem na profesní dráhu ve výzkumu a vývoji, vi) vytvoření nezávislé expertní úrovně dohlížející na bezpečnost a legislativní/eti",

Národní infrastruktura CZECRIN je zformována pod vedením Masarykovy univerzity jako příjemce a Fakultní nemocnice u sv. Anny v Brně (FNUSA) jako dalším účastníkem projektu. Podstatou infrastruktury CZECRIN je úzká spolupráce mezi akademickými, výzkumnými a klinickými pracovišti, jež je reflektována i v organizaci a organizační struktuře. Základními stavebními jednotkami jsou Univerzitní a Klinický modul. Univerzitní modul řídí metodickou podporu, koordinaci a nezávislý monitoring klinického hodnocení, sběr, uchování a analýzu klinických dat a edukaci v oblasti klinického hodnocení, současně je nositelem výzkumných aktivit v předmětné oblasti. Masarykova univerzita je národním kontaktním bodem s napojením na mezinárodní konsorcium ECRIN-ERIC. Univerzitní modul je synergicky doplněn modulem Klinickým, který je metodicky řízen FNUSA, jehož klíčovou funkcí je identifikace pacientů naplňujících kritéria klinického hodnocení se zvláštním zřetelem na méně časné diagnózy vyžadující širokou kooperaci zdravotnických zařízení. Další funkcí Klinického modulu je implementace standardů klinického hodnocení v legislativním kontextu ČR a praktické provedení klinického hodnocení. Oba moduly společně zajišťují interakci s regulatorními orgány ČR. Infrastruktura tímto pokrývá oblast celé České republiky a je schopna zajistit přípravné, prováděcí i kontrolní činnosti při provádění akademických klinických hodnocení a klinických studií teoreticky v jakékoliv fázi i jakékoliv odbornosti. Národním kontaktním místem infrastruktury CZECRIN pro zahraničí je Masarykova univerzita, prostřednictvím pracoviště Farmakologického ústavu Lékařské fakulty, s napojením na mezinárodní konsorcium ECRIN-ERIC.",

Přestože je tento typ onemocnění vzácný, jde po úrazech o druhou nejčastější příčinu úmrtí u dětí. Léčba těchto pacientů je v České republice centralizovaná do dvou specializovaných center: Klinika dětské hematologie a onkologie FN Motol v Praze a Klinika dětské onkologie FN Brno. Léčbu hematoonkologických pacientů taktéž částečně zajišťují pracoviště v Ostravě, Olomouci, Plzni, Hradci Králové, Plzni, Českých Budějovicích a Ústí nad Labem. V souladu s doporučením rady Evropy (2009/C 151/02) centra FN Motol a FN Brno založila a udržují databázi diagnostikovaných a léčených dětských pacientů. Databáze obsahuje přes 6 tisíc záznamů pacientů diagnostikovaných od roku 1995. Data z klinické databáze jsou v tuto chvíli využívána k interním klinickým a vědeckým účelům, nicméně jejich rozsah je omezen na klinické události a poskytnutou léčbu v jednom ze dvou hlavních center. Pro vstup do mezinárodních projektů je nezbytné propojení s dalšími datovými zdroji a celková validace a standardizace dostupných údajů. Chybí údaje o dlouhodobém přežívání, o sekundárních komorbiditách včetně sekundárních malignit diagnostikovaných v dospělosti. Taktéž dosud nemohla být provedena analýza ke stanovení skutečného rozsahu nemocné populace v ČR. Tento současný deficit v datových zdrojích vyřazuje Českou republiku z mezinárodních projektů jako je EUROCARE nebo ACCIS, do kterých svými daty aktivně přispívají všechny sousední státy. Cílem projektu je vyřešit tento závažný nedostatek vytěžením všech dostupných datových zdrojů s následnou důkladnou statistickou analýzou a zpřístupněním výsledků formou informačního a vzdělávacího portálu.",

Pro sebeobnovu potřebují hPSC aktivní signalizaci receptoru pro fibroblastový růstový faktor (FGFR). Pokud není FGFR signalizace aktivní, hPSC ztrácejí pluripotenci a zvyšují apoptózu.\nDříve jsme prokázali, že exogenní FGF2 zvyšuje klonogenní kapacitu a potlačuje apoptózu. Současně hPSC syntetizují vlastní FGF2; jeho nízkomolekulární izoforma je sekretována a předpokládá se její autokrinní/parakrinní efekt na sebeobnovu. Avšak existence takovéto smyčky nebyla jasně prokázána a její další úloha ve fyziologii hPSC je nejasná. V procesu sekrece FGF2 bylo popsáno několik molekul; doposud známými intracelulárními regulátory jsou ATP1A1, TEC a Translokin/CEP57. Existence těchto molekul nebyla u hPSC popsána. Naše předběžné výsledky však indikují, že přinejmenším TEC je v hPSC exprimován. Hlavním cílem projektu je tedy objasnění mechanismu sekrece FGF2 a role apokrinní/parakrinní signální smyčky FGF2 ve fyziologii hPSC.",

Direct reprogramming process involves lineage conversion by transient induction of cellular plastic state, leading to epigenetic erasure of cell identity that is permissive to lineage switch upon specific stimulus. Since the direct reprogramming does not revert cells to pluripotency, it does not harbor safety concerns typical for pluripotent stem cells, thus holds the great promise in regenerative medicine. However, the direct reprogramming is achieved by introduction of exogenous genes, which still limits the practical application of this technique. The general aim of this project is to remove this limitation using microRNA manipulation. In this project we will identify microRNA molecules, that are crucial for the induction of cellular plasticity and we will test, whether manipulation with these microRNA can lead to direct reprogramming of somatic cells into neural lineage.",

Získaná data přinesou zejména zcela nové poznatky o změnách v profilech aktivity RTK a MAPK ve vztahu k průběhu onemocnění u těchto pacientů, stejně jako o vztahu profilů aktivity RTK a MAPK ke změnám růstových parametrů sarkomových buněk v podmínkách in vitro.",

Zařazení subjektů s významným afektivním zkreslením kognice či nedostatečného emočního uvědomění umožní modelování dysfunkcí základních procesů, které determinují sociální kognici.

Ze zárodečných vrstev se vytváří všechny typy tělních buněk. Jakým způsobem se zárodečné vrstvy v lidském embryu formují zůstává nejasné. Pro objasnění úlohy Aktivin signálování během časné specializace lidských embryonálních kmenových buněk (hESC) použijeme vývojový model získaný z hESC, který rekapituluje časná vývojová stádia in vivo. Zjistili jsme, že protein-tyrozin fosfatáza 1B (PTP1B) je nově objeveným partnerem Aktivin dráhy a že rozhoduje o vývoji do mezentodermu nebo neuroektodermu. V navrhovaném projektu se budeme zabývat identifikací cílových genů a expresních profilů ovlivněných prostřednictvím PTP1B, které rozhodují o budoucí neurálním a mezentodermálním osudu. Dále specifikujeme buněčný typ/y derivované z  mezentodermálních kmenových buněk. Tento projekt má za cíl objasnit roli Aktivin/ALK4/PTP1B signálování během rozhodování o osudu zárodečných vrstev, což může osvětlit způsob formování zárodečných vrstev lidského embrya.",

S poznáním genomu a se zavedením nových technologií je koncept personalizované medicíny vztažen především k možnostem uzpůsobit navrženou farmakoterapii konkrétnímu jedinci na základě molekulárně-genetického testování. Specifickou kapitolou v rámci personalizované farmakoterapie jsou pak léčivé přípravky (LP) pro moderní terapii, kam řadíme přípravky genové či somatobuněčné terapie nebo přípravky tkáňového inženýrství. S rozvojem této oblasti medicíny se debatuje o regulaci těchto přístupů a s tím související zásadní otázky etické.\n\nOdlišnost moderních terapií přesahuje současný rámec právní a regulační úpravy. Je nutné řešit otázky v oblasti zajištění jejich kvality a bezpečnosti, stejně jako otázky jejich dostupnosti pacientům. Navrhovaný výzkumný projekt si klade za cíl zmapovat a zhodnotit regulační rámec léčiv pro personalizovanou terapii.\n\nProjekt bude rozdělen do tří tematických celků. Jsou jimi: (I) vývoj nových léčiv, (II) jejich výroba a uvádění na trh a (III) použití ve zdravotní péči.  Výzkum v rámci každého celku bude rozdělen do tří fází. V první fázi budou provedeny studie o současném stavu každé oblasti v České republice, v Evropě a ve světě. Druhá fáze projektu bude analyzovat výstupy předchozí fáze za účelem reflexe stávající regulace, identifikace oblastí s nedostatečnou či nadbytečnou regulací. Třetí fáze spočívá v publikování dosažených poznatků.\n\nVedle teoretických výstupů bude praktickým přínosem projektu zejména formulace národních doporučení (metodiky, best practices) pro správní úřady, etické komise, zadavatele klinických hodnocení, poskytovatele zdravotních služeb a výzkumné instituce včetně Masarykovy univerzity.",

Farmakologicky velmi zajímavými skupinami rostlinných alkaloidů jsou benzofenantridinové alkaloidy, které se vyznačují hlavně svými protinádorovými účinky, a kanabinoidy, jenž lze využít například pro léčbu deprese a úzkosti, neurodegenerativních onemocnění a dalších vážných onemocnění mozku. Obě tyto skupiny alkaloidů poskytují proto velmi cennou inspiraci pro návrh a vývoj léčiv.\nVlastní proces vývoje nových léčiv je však i v současné době velkou výzvou pro výzkumné instituce i pro komerční společnosti. Tento proces zahrnuje návrh struktury léčiva pomocí chemoinformatických metodik, jeho syntéza a jeho laboratorní testování (t.j, analýza jeho interakcí s cílovými biomakromolekulami, testování na buněčných a tkáňových kulturách, in vivo testy).  Díky možnosti vytvoření mezioborového projektu v rámci MU a zapojení výzkumných týmů s kvalitní expertízou v požadovaných oblastech se nám otevírá prostor na tuto výzvu reagovat. \nHlavním cílem našeho projektu je nalézt dosud neprozkoumané biologicky aktivní molekuly ze skupiny benzofenanthridinů a kanabinoidů. Vybrané z těchto látek pak plánujeme zakoupit nebo syntetizovat a provést s nimi laboratorní testy. \nVelmi důležitým cílem našeho projektu je také zpřístupnit jednotlivé komponenty procesu návrhu a testování léků léků a jiných biologicky aktivních substancí dalším pracovištím MU. Pro tyto účely rovněž plánujeme připravit software a IT prostředí, sloužící k provádění chemoinformatických analýz rostlinných alkaloidů.\nPři realizaci projektu využijeme hlubokou expertízu v oblasti benzofenantridinových alkaloidů (LF, Biochemický ústav) a v oblasti kanabinoidů (CEITEC, Centrum neurověd). Dále začleníme pokročilou expertízu v oblasti chemoinformatických metodik (CEITEC, Centrum Strukturní biologie) a v oblasti IT (ÚVT). Poté využijeme rozsáhlé zkušenosti z oboru organické syntézy (PřF, Ústav chemie) a z oboru analýzy biomolekulárních interakcí (PřF, NCBR a Ústav chemie). Na závěr využijeme pokročilé know-how v oblasti testování na buněčných kulturách (LF, Biologický ústav), na tkáňových kulturách (CEITEC, Centrum neurověd) a in vivo (CEITEC, Centrum neurověd).",

Malá část těchto nádorů však v rozporu s teoretickou prognózou časně metastazuje do lymfatických uzlin, což je prvním krokem směřujícím k delokalizaci nádorového  onemocnění. V současné době existuje urgentní klinická potřeba nalezení vhodného diagnostického přístupu, který by umožnil selektovat skupinu pacientek s vyšším rizikem metastazování a indikovat vhodnou agresivnější terapii, která by snížila riziko relapsu onemocnění. Za tímto účelem bude analyzován klinickopatologicky charakterizovaný soubor 48 low-grade nádorů prsu pomocí pokročilých přístupů systémové biologie: Analýzy transkriptomu sekvenováním nové generace, pomocí SWATH proteomiky a s využitím digitální patologie. Budou rovněž hledány proteiny na povrchu nádorové buňky vhodné jako cíle biologické terapie. Získaná data budou následně analyzována jednak unimodálně (zpracování dat jednoho typu), jednak multimodálně.

Výzkum procesu selhání mechanické srdeční funkce na buněčné a molekulární úrovni lze sledovat a modelovat již na jednotlivých srdečních buňkách. Kardiomyocyty lze bez zásahu do srdeční tkáně získat diferenciací z indukovaných pluripotentních kmenových buněk (iPS). Srdeční buňky tak vyrůstají a tepají v laboratorní misce, stačí malý kousek kůže dárce. Pokud je dárcem člověk s dědičným onemocněním srdce, lze u jeho srdečních buněk sledovat mechanické a elektrické projevy.\nRůst na běžných površích však nedovoluje iPS-kardiomyocytům volné kontrakce a omezuje plnohodnotné zrání. Špatná biologická odpověď srdečních buněk se projevuje jejich přeměnou ve vazivo (fibroblasty) a ztrátou mechanické funkce.\n \nPrimárním cílem práce je nalézt takový substrát, který by neomezoval kontraktilitu, zamezil přeměně a podporoval kardiomyocyty v růstu. Toho je možné dosáhnout pomocí nových nanomateriálů založených na bázi biopolymerů. Tyto materiály mívají díky svému polymernímu základu a vysoké porositě výbornou elasticitu. Podporují tak růst dospělých srdečních buněk v animálním modelu.\n \nZároveň je potřeba povrch upravit tak, aby co nejvíce připomínal vznikající srdeční tkáň. Modifikaci povrchu lze provést plasmochemicky, na povrch působí speciální druh nízkoteplotního elektrického plazmatu. Na ošetřených površích je možné generovat funkční chemické skupiny, které zajistí hledanou biokompatabilitu. Plasmochemické reakce jsou pro vyšší efektivitu často kombinovány s klasickými chemickými reakcemi. Dalším cílem práce je adaptace povrchu substrátu tak, aby podporoval specializaci, růst, zrání a mechanickou funkci iPS-kardiomyocytů.\n \nTřetím dílčím cílem je kultivace kardiomyocytů v zátěžových podmínkách (pod vlivem farmak a mechanického stresu) a sledování změn jejich funkčních vlastností. Na úrovni jednotlivých buněk lze kontrakce popsat s pomocí mikroskopie atomárních sil (AFM). Metodami molekulární biologie lze popsat změny strukturálních vlastnosti buněk a jejich metabolismu. Na úrovni jednotlivých kardiomyocytů můžeme tak sledovat mechanismy zapříčiňující v organismu srdeční selhání a hledat pro jeho terapii nová léčiva a terapeutické postupy.",

   "annotation": "Léčba hematoonkologických onemocnění (HON), která je stále účinnější, což se vyznačuje vyléčením stále větší proporce nemocných, se projevuje řadou vedlejších účinků, které zhoršují kvalitu života pacientů. Nejčastějším vedlejším efektem je enormní únava a nevýkonnost, která provází pacienta obvykle od začátku onemocnění, zhoršuje se v průběhu terapie a často přetrvává i roky po jejím úspěšném ukončení. Jedna z hlavních příčin této únavy pramení ze snížené celkové zdatnosti (=dekondice), která je dána zpravidla negativní změnou poměru aktivní tělesné hmoty vůči tukové složce a poklesu pohybové aktivity (PA). Ukazuje se, že únava provázející maligní onemocnění má úzký vztah k celkové aktivitě autonomomního nervového systému (ANS), zejména k aktivitě vagu. Spektrální analýzou (SA) variability srdeční frekvence (HRV) lze neinvazivně posoudit funkční stav ANS. Je známo, že pravidelné cvičení zvyšuje jednak tělesnou zdatnost, jednak způsobuje pozitivní změny ANS, a to jak u zdravých, tak i u nemocných osob. Přestože existují nepochybné důkazy o pozitivním vlivu PA na celkový průběh řady onkologických onemocnění, je překvapivé, že i v rámci odborné podpůrné péče není vůbec doporučována, mnohdy jsou nemocní dokonce přímo odrazováni. Aplikaci PA u hematoonkologických pacientů, kteří tvoří v rámci onkologie specifickou podskupinu nemocných, ztěžuje výrazné postižení produkce krevních elementů poruchy krevního srážení a také snížení výkonnosti imunitního systému. Dosavadní těžiště léčby HON leží výlučně v podání různě agresivní chemoterapie a nemocní tak tvoří z hlediska možnosti fyzického tréninku značně heterogenní populaci. Z tohoto důvodu je velmi žádoucí fundovaný prospektivní  klinický interdisciplinární výzkum, na jehož základě by bylo možno vytvořit směrnice pro preskripce programu PA, které by bylo možno implementovat do standardních klinických postupů. Fyzický trénink je sice na pohled velmi logickou a bezproblémovou intervencí, bezpečné převedení této myšlenky do rutinní klinické praxe je však velmi obtížný úkol. Na jeho řešení je bezpodmínečná úzká spolupráce jak specialistů hematoonkologů tak specialistů v oboru fyzioterapie i tělesné výchovy a sportu. Cílem projektu je kromě tvorby tréninkových guidelines i přímé ovlivnění chorobého procesu, tedy o jakousi formu podpůrné \"léčby pohybem\".",

Dalším krokem výzkumu pak bude aplikace skórovacích systémů do procesu indikování efektivity terapie u stočlenného experimentálního souboru dětí po úrazech dolních končetin. Posledním krokem projektu pak bude přesný a komplexní popis experimentálně ověřené metody včasné predikce efektivity rehabilitační terapie v plánované monografii a publikování stěžejních zjištění v impaktovaném periodiku.",

MikroRNA (miRNA) jsou nedávno identifikované molekuly RNA, které se uplatňují jako zásadní intracelulární mediátory procesů, které se účastní adaptace na pohybovou aktivitu, včetně angiogeneze, zánětu, mitochondriálního metabolismu, tvorby kontraktilní síly v srdečním/kosterním svalů a svalové hypertrofie. I když cirkulující molekuly miRNA (c-miRNA) byly studovány jako biomarkery u řady onemocnění, chybějí údaje definující úlohu c-miRNA v podmínkách akutní tréninkové zátěže i dlouhodobého tréninku u zdravých osob a není známa jejich korelace s hladinami mikroRNA v moči a slinách. Tento projekt se zabývá definicí expresních profilů specifických miRNA v různých tělních tekutinách (sérum/moč/sliny) u různých typů tréninku (aerobní vytrvalostní, explozivní silový a hypertrofický trénink) a dává je do souvislosti s dalšími adaptivními procesy souvisejícími s tréninkem, detekovatelnými při klinickém vyšetření jedince, zejména s parametry fyzické zdatnosti. Předkládaný projekt unikátním způsobem spojuje přístupy moderní fyziologie, molekulární epigenetiky a sportovních věd (zátěžové fyziologie) a svými výstupy přispěje ke zlepšení chápání úlohy mikroRNA v adaptaci na fyzickou zátěž u zdravé populace.",

Hlavním cílem projektu je integrovat do výzkumu lidských kosterních pozůstatků vymřelých populací (z různých historických období – od pravěku do novověku), nejmodernější pokročilé genomické metody, užívané v současném onkologickém výzkumu, za účelem studia nádorových onemocnění. Tento přístup zatím nebyl v historické antropologii (paleopatologii) aplikován. Integrace těchto metod do paleoonkologie by měla umožnit přesnou a jednoznačnou diagnostiku u nádorů primárně diagnostikovaných prostřednictvím diferenciální diagnostiky nebo pomoci zúžit interval možných nádorových typů. U metastáz by zavedení těchto metod mělo pomoci určit primární lokalizaci nádoru. Cílem interdisciplinárního výzkumu je modifikace v současnosti využívané metodiky v medicínském výzkumu a klinické praxi tak, aby byla použitelná u fragmentované a degradované historické DNA a aby se tento typ diagnostiky mohl stát běžnou součástí paleopatologického studia nádorových onemocnění u historických populací. \nVýsledky molekulárně biologické a paleopatologické analýzy kostry postiženého jedince budou dále propojeny s poznatky současné klinické praxe, bude proveden pokus o rekonstrukci možného průběhu onemocnění na základě analogií s průběhem nemocnění u současných pacientů a jeho frekvencí v recentní populaci. Konečná diagnóza bude spojena s historickými a archeologickými znalostmi o způsobu života v období z něhož zkoumaný člověk pocházel.\nPříkladem onkologického onemocnění známé historické osobnosti, které by si zasloužilo další diagnostiku způsobem navrhovaným v tomto projektu, je případ českého krále Ladislava Pohrobka (*1440 - †1457), u kterého Emanuel Vlček diagnostikoval klasickou cestou (morfologicky a rentgenologicky) non-Hodgkinův lymfom (lymfosarkom) v generalizovaném stádiu.",

   "annotation": "Stafylokokové infekce způsobují řadu lidských onemocnění od mírných zánětů kůže a měkkých tkání až po život ohrožující pneumonii, meningitidu a sepsi. Léčba stafylokokových infekcí je komplikovaná častým výskytem kmenů rezistentních na antibiotika. Zejména meticilin-rezistentní kmeny Staphylococcus aureus, hojně rozšířené v nemocničních zařízeních, představují celosvětově závažný zdravotnický problém. Bakteriofágy mohou být využity jako alternativní terapeutika bakteriálních infekcí, zejména kmenů rezistentních proti antibiotikům. Kvůli chybějící legislativě související se schválením fágů jako léčiv, v žádném ze států Evropské Unie, USA, ani ostatních vyspělých zemí není na trhu dostupný fágový preparát k léčbě lidských bakteriálních infekcí. Popis infekčního cyklu fága na molekulární úrovni\nje jedna z nezbytných podmínek pro schválení terapeutického využití fágové terapie. Analýza faktorů, které určují schopnosti bakteriofágů infikovat S. aureus je předpokladem pro vývoj geneticky modifikovaných fágů cíleně působících na patogenní multirezistentní bakterie. \nV rámci předkládaného grantu plánujeme studovat jaké klinické kmeny S. aureus je fág 812K1-420 schopen infikovat. Srovnáním kmenů S. aureus rezistentních a citlivých k fágu 812K1-420 budeme schopni identifikovat buněčné receptory pro fága. V komplementárních experimentech s mutantními fágy určíme, které proteiny umožňují fágovi 812K1-420 rozpoznat buňky S. aureus. Klinická část výzkumu se\ntaké zaměří na analýzu schopnosti fága 812K1-420 infikovat bakteriální buňky perzistující uvnitř makrofágů a rostoucí v biofilmu a na potenciální synergické působení antibiotik a fágů pro eliminaci S. aureus. S použitím kryo-elektronové tomografie budeme studovat mechanismus injekce (doručení) fágové DNA do buněk S. aureus a sestavování dceřiných virionů v infikovaných bakteriálních buňkách. S pomocí kryo-elektronové mikroskopie a počítačové analýzy obrazu určíme trojrozměrnou strukturu fága s vysokým rozlišením, kterou použijeme k interpretaci tomogramů. Strukturní studie doplníme analýzou exprese fágových genů v různých fázích infekce. Naše výsledky získané kombinací molekulárně-biologických, strukturních a klinických přístupů umožní další vývoj a formální schválení využití tohoto fága pro terapii stafylokokových infekcí u člověka.",

Hlavním cílem je zjistit, zda behaviorální změny vyvolané intervencí budou mít hodnotitelný korelát na MRI mozku ve smyslu zvýšení mozkové funkční konektivity ve vybraných klidových mozkových sítích a/nebo ve zvýšení objemu šedé hmoty v relevantních oblastech zapojených zejména do motoriky a paměťových funkcí. \nJedná se o kontrolovanou randomizovanou studii s křížovým designem (každý subjekt bude sám sobě kontrolou po dobu 6 měsíců, kdy nebude probíhat žádná pravidelná tanečně-pohybová aktivita). Studie bude realizována na vzorku 120 zdravých jedinců, rozdělených na 2 skupiny. U obou skupin postupně aplikujeme tanečně-pohybový intervenční 6měsíční program, frekvence jednotlivých lekcí bude 2x týdně/60 minut. \nHodnocení obou skupin (aktivní, kontrolní) bude prováděno zaslepeně, zaškoleným pracovníkem. Použijeme standardizované psychometrické testy/škály (hodnocení kognitivních funkcí ve všech kognitivních doménách pomocí baterie testů, hodnocení afektivních změn pomocí dotazníku, hodnocení aerobní fyzické zdatnosti a posturální stability pomocí speciálních testů).

Budeme též studovat integritu mozkových drah pomocí difusního měření a traktografie. Účastníci budou komplexně vyšetřeni při vstupu do studie a po 6 měsících intervence v případě aktivní skupiny/ bez intervence v případě kontrolní skupiny. Aktivní skupina bude navíc vyšetřena pomocí MRI mozku po dalších 3 měsících a v plném rozsahu po půlroce od ukončení intervence.

Ze vzorku plazmy/séra odebrané při přijetí budou analyzovány biomarkery (v plánu troponin, pentraxin-3, CRP, quescin-6, NGAL, FABP a další) ve spolupráci s Ústavem patologické fyziologie LF MU a Oddělení klinické biochemie FN Brno. U části pacientů bude diagnóza akutní myokarditidy potvrzena pomocí NMR srdce. Pacienti budou sledování s cílem popsat jejich střednědobou prognózu.",

Nicméně  není potvrzeno, že inhalační aerosolová terapie vede ke zvýšení rezistence HME filtrů a neexistuje konsenzus kam umístit v okruhu filtr během inhalační terapie. \nCíl: Cílem je zhodnotit změnu odporu HME filtrů umístěných v dýchacím okruhu po aplikaci nebulizovaných léků během umělé plicní ventilace.\nMetoda :Rezistence filtru bude měřena na mechanickém modelu umělé plicní ventilace.

   "annotation": "Za posledních 30 let zaznamenaly obrazem navigované intervence zásadní pokrok při léčbě pacientů s onkologickým onemocněním. Zdokonalením prošly nejen zobrazovací metody užívané při navigaci - ultrazvuk, skiaskopie, výpočetní tomografie, magnetická rezonance, ale rovněž paralelně s nimi i techniky endovaskulární či intratumorální léčby. V současnosti jsme schopni aplikovat lokoregionální chemoterapii, provádět chemoembolizaci s drug eluting beads.  Punkčními technikami jsme schopni provádět RFA, MW ablace, ireverzibilní elektroporace. Kombinací metod lokální tumor destrukce a cíleného podání chemoterapeutika se protinádorový účinek díky synergii může znásobit.\nOnkologické intervence (nyní jako zásadní a samostatná část intervenční radiologie) jsou postupy miniinvazivní s nízkou mírou komplikací.  Konkurentem tumor destrukčních výkonů navigovaných obrazem jsou otevřené chirurgické postupy. Konkurentem lokoregionální aplikace chemoterapeutik nebo chemoembolizace je systémová aplikace léčiv, zejména biologické terapie.  I když srovnáním protinádorového efektu onkologických intervencí se zabývají mnohé publikace, ve světové literatuře jsou jen částečné informace o farmakoekonomické efektivitě těchto specifických metod léčby.   \nNáš projekt je zaměřený na vyhodnocení onkologických intervencí prováděných na našem pracovišti v celém spektru solidních tumorů včetně farmakoekonomických aspektů. Cílem je porovnat cost-efectiveness onkologických intervenčních metod se standardní široce dostupnou onkologickou léčbou. Vedlejším cílem je vypracování místních postupů a standardů při užití těchto specifických metod. Součástí projektu je zhodnocení i některých intervenčních metod, které nejsou terapeutické, ale zcela zásadně se spolupodílí včetně obrazové diagnostiky na léčbě pacienta (např. perkutánní biopsie, choledochoskopie, 3D navigace ultrazvukem naváděných intervencí). Využití těchto moderních metod může zpřesnit a urychlit dosažení výsledků, ale stejně může být i jen zdrojem dodatečných nákladů pro zdravotní systém.  \nProjekt přímo navazuje na projekt specifického výzkumu řešeného v roce 2011 na naší klinice v rámci projektů Lékařské fakulty Masarykovi univerzity, kde přínos radiologických diagnostických a terapeutických metod byl srovnáván s nežádoucími účinky ionizujícího záření.",

Tento léčebný přístup zdůrazňuje systematické užití znalostí o nádorovém onemocnění a jednotlivci  k výběru a optimalizaci terapie. V současnosti čelíme v dětské onkologii skutečnosti, že jsou dostupné desítky a v blízké budoucnosti stovky protinádorových preparátů, jejichž mechanismus účinku je biologický, tj. cíleně zasahuje konkrétní terapeutický terč. Role v léčbě dětí s nádory však není doposud jasně definována a přínos musí být ve většině případů teprve ustanoven. V projektu  provedeme analýzu užití personalizovaných postupů léčby na našem pracovišti. Budou sledovány klinické ukazatele popisující indikaci, efektivitu a toxicitu personalizované léčby a budou zhodnocena dostupná genomická a proteomická data o nádorové tkáni a jejím hostiteli. Dále budeme pokračovat v analýze individualizovaných postupů léčby z předchozího projektu (optimalizace léčby antifoláty, asparaginázou, metronomická terapie).",

Zisk velkého množství buněk, potřebných pro buněčnou terapii nebo modelování chorob, vyžaduje dlouhodobou kultivaci v podmínkách in vitro. Nicméně v předchozím výzkumu bylo zjištěno, že během dlouhodobé in vitro kultivace se výrazně snižuje aktivita bázové excizní reparace (BER), díky snížení exprese apurinní/apyrimidinní endonukleázy 1 (APE1), a následně se tak zvyšuje frekvence mutací a destabilizuje genom. V naší hypotéze předpokládáme, že kvůli snížené aktivitě BER nedochází k vytvoření dostatečného množství dvouřetězcových zlomů (díky seskupenému poškození bází) a tím dochází k nedostatečné aktivaci kontrolního bodu G1/S. Poškození bází proto proniká dále v buněčném cyklu. Toto poškození by mělo vyvolat zástavu replikační vidlice a aktivovat homologií rekombinaci (HR). Zvýšená frekvence mutací u LEKB z pozdní pasáže a buněk s downregulovanou/inhibovanou APE1 však napovídá, že i mechanizmus HR by u buněk z pozdní pasáže mohl být méně aktivní, než u pasáže časné. Aby bylo možné v budoucnu cíleně zvýšit genomovou stabilitu dlouhodobě kultivovaných LEKB, je nejdříve zapotřebí analyzovat a porozumět mechanizmům HR a kontrolních bodů zodpovědných za eliminaci poškození genomu. Cílem projektu tedy bude analýza aktivity HR a kontrolních bodů (buněčného cyklu) v závislosti na dlouhodobé kultivaci LEKB a aktivitě BER.",

   "annotation": "V předchozích letech byla věnována pozornost velkým geriatrickým syndromům jako zásadnímu limitujícímu faktoru pro zachování soběstačnosti seniorů. Senioři se po překonání určitých typů zdravotních komplikací dožijí životního údobí, kdy se začínají kumulovat choroby, narůstá počet užívaných medikamentů, kompenzační mechanismy slábnou. Důsledkem je postupný vznik stařecké křehkosti s častými dekompenzacemi zdravotního stavu a postupnou ztrátou soběstačnosti. Cílem projektu je definovat závažnost jednotlivých předpokládaných rizikových faktorů ztráty soběstačnosti a sestavit profylaktická opatření pro její zachování. Další řešenou oblastí projektu jsou možnosti primární prevence těchto syndromů, tedy ovlivnění výskytu metabolického syndromu, osteoporózy a sarkopenie, demencí a depresí v populaci maldších věkových skupin, přičemž doba pro primární prevenci některých těchto syndromů začíná již ve druhém životním deceniu",

   "annotation": "Zamýšleným výstupem projektu „Využití termografických metod u diagnostiky syndromu diabetické nohy a hodnocení revaskularizace dolní končetiny za pomocí termografických měření a stanovení transkutánní tenze kyslíku“ je nalezení vzájemné korelace mezi termografickými systémy a klinicky využívanými diagnostickými metodami při léčbě ICHDKK a syndromu diabetické nohy. Hlavním cílem projektu je zavedení termovizní techniky v praxi jako další metody pro hodnocení revaskularizace dolních končetin a zapojení této techniky jako eventuální rovnocenné náhrady ke klinickým metodám Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) či stanovení transkutánní tenze kyslíku (TcpO2).\nDalším záměrem je využití termovizních kamer jako diagnostických nástrojů u nejasných případů onemocnění a následné léčby, kde právě v kombinaci se zavedenými metodami může snadno a téměř s nulovou zátěží pro pacienta indikovat postižené místo a pomoci tak lékaři k nastavení vhodného léčebného postupu, což vede ke zkvalitnění péče o pacienta. Realizace projektu má vést k zavedení termovizní techniky do oblasti vyšetření diabetických i nediabetických pacientů, v tomto konkrétním případě zejména s ohledem na prováděné operativní revaskularizace na pracovišti II. chirurgické kliniky FN u sv. Anny a LF MU v Brně.\nSpecifita projektu je dána přímou spoluprací klinického a teoretického pracoviště, kdy je diagnóza pacienta stanovena či několika metodami. Unikátním je právě propojení termografických zařízení se stanovením transkutánní tenze kyslíku (TcpO2). Přístroj pro stanovení transkutánní tenze kyslíku byl pořízen v tomto roce na základě společného požadavku obou pracovišť (Biofyzikální ústav a II. chirurgická klinika) a s předpokladem společného využití při další spolupráci. Aktuálnost tohoto tématu dokazují statistické údaje, vykazující vzrůstající trend výskytu diabetes mellitus.",

Výzkumná témata, která jsou v oblasti základního výzkumu zaměřena na modelování a objasnění etiopatogeneze lidských onemocnění tak mohou přímo ovlivňovat budoucí diagnostické a terapeutické postupy. \nCílem tohoto projektu je získávat nové vědecké informace z biomedicinsky orientovaných výzkumných témat, která mají potenciál objasňovat podstatu lidských onemocnění. Půjde přitom o aplikaci metod molekulárně-biologických, molekulárně-genetických a metod buněčné biologie. Na výzkumu se budou podílet samostatné vědecké týmy Biologického ústavu LF MU disponujícími odlišnými výzkumnými tématy a nástroji, které budou mít vědeckou kvalitu minimálně evropské úrovně a současně potenciál pro navazující translační lékařský výzkum, tak jak je provozován v rámci LF MU.\nCílem tohoto projektu je také vědecká výchova magisterských a doktorských studentů pro práci v klíčových výzkumných oblastech a s důrazem na ovládnutí moderních výzkumných a diagnostických technik. Důraz bude kladen na technicky náročnou výchova přímo ve výzkumných laboratořích spojenou se zvládnutím a rozvojem moderních výzkumných postupů a vzájemným předáváním laboratorních zkušeností, dovedností a znalostí.

Cílem 1. subprojektu je zavést novou unikátní diagnostickou metodu – Contact Heat Evoked Potentials (CHEPS), která umožňuje neinvazivně testovat integritu a dysfunkci termoalgických drah a center na periferní i centrální úrovni. Kromě samostatné analýzy evokovaných odpovědí je cílem i multimodální registrace CHEPS současně s funkční magnetickou rezonancí (fMR), což umožní současně studovat mechanismy percepce bolesti na centrální mozkové úrovni. Tento diagnostický nástroj je k dispozici pouze v několika výzkumných centrech na světě. Cílem dalšího subprojektu bude zkoumat mechanismy endogenní inhibice a facilitace bolesti pomocí metodiky „Conditioned pain modulation“(CMP) a „Temporal summation“ (TS) u chronických bolestivých syndromů s neuropatickou komponentou – bolestí zad a roztroušené sklerózy, včetně možnosti predikce rozvoje neuropatické bolesti a odpovídavosti na léčbu. Cílem posledního subprojektu pak bude ověřit specificitu stanovení hustoty intraepidermálních nervových vláken (IENFD) pomocí kožní biopsie v určení neuropatie tenkých vláken (SFN) u jedné z klinických jednotek, která může SFN napodobovat – u spondylogenní cervikální myelopatie (SCM). Nutnost verifikace specificity metodiky byla jedním z klíčových bodů recentně publikovaného doporučení AAN pro využití vyšetření intraepidermální hustoty tenkých nervových vláken z kožní biopsie v diagnostickém algoritmu polyneuropatií (England 2009). Podobné nálezy nebyly u SCM dosud nikdy publikovány, z dalších jednotek, poteniálně imitujících SFN, byly hodnoceny pouze u roztroušené sklerózy (Herrmann, 2010).",

Ty se projevují aktivací satelitních gliových buněk, invazí aktivovaných makrofágů a expresí pro- a protizánětlivých cytokinů a jejich receptorů nejen ve spinálních gangliích souvisejících s poškozeným nervem, ale i ve strukturách vzdálených segmentů. Šíření zánětové reakce do spinálních ganglií vzdálených míšních segmentů může probíhat krevní a/nebo likvorovou cestou. Naše dřívější experimenty prokázaly průnik značeného dextranu z likvoru a krve do spinálního ganglia, což prokazuje prostupnost hemato-nervové a likvor-nervové bariéry pro molekuly velikosti cytokinů (Joukal et al., 2013). \nPředpokládáme, že subarachnoideální prostor vyplněný likvorem dosahuje do těsné blízkosti spinálních ganglií a dává anatomický podklad pro šíření molekul z likvoru do spinálního ganglia. Současně také předpokládáme, že uspořádání mikrovaskularizace spinálního ganglia z radikulárních cév a jejich vztah k likvorovému prostoru dává morfologický základ pro šíření molekul krevní cestou.\nExperimenty budou provedeny na 20 potkanech linie Wistar (samci, 250-300 g). Po odběru spinálních ganglií společně s kořeny míšního nervu a segmentu míchy bez poškození obalů míšních a cévního zásobení bude provedeno jejich projasnění metodou „CLARITY“.

Takové biomarkery by následně mohly sloužit ke zvážení další intenzifikace léčby či změny léčebného postupu v případě horší prognózy. Pro tento typ výzkumu je nezbytné vytvořit unikátní spolupráci několika pracovišť LF MU.",

Předpokládáme, že během patogeneze MM je exprese sady genů spojených s aktivací progrese buněčného cyklu v dynamické rovnováze s expresí sady genů inhibujících tento proces.  Tato rovnováha plní funkci kompenzačního mechanismu onkogenních událostí. Přes existenci kompenzačního mechanismu není regulace buněčného cyklu vyvážená z důvodu rostoucího „onkogenního tlaku“ během patogeneze MM. Předpokládáme, že v daném čase jsou v organizmu přítomny různé subpopulace MM buněk, které mohou tvořit zásobu pro nádorovou obnovu, růst a diseminaci.  Domníváme se, že právě B buňky jsou zde klíčové a slouží jako východisko pro iniciaci onkogenních události u MM buněk.

Pro tyto bakterie je charakteristická také schopnost uniknout imunitnímu systému příslušného hostitele a tato schopnost je dávána do souvislosti s genomovou variabilitou příslušného treponemálního kmene. Detekce variabilních míst na úrovni příslušného treponemálního kmene tak může vést k většímu porozumění mechanizmů patogeneze treponemálních onemocnění. V této práci navrhujeme identifikovat variabilní úseky v genomech vybraných treponemálních kmenů na základě in silico analýzy dostupných sekvenačních dat, dále charakterizovat vnitrokmenovou variabilitu syfilitického kmene DAL-1 v průběhu experimentální infekce v králíkovi a na základě toho identifikovat genetickou variabilitu v treponemální DNA izolované z lidského klinického materiálu.",

Velmi významně se zinečnaté ionty uplatňují v řadě patologií, mimo jiné i v patogenzi tumorů prostaty. Prostatické buňky jsou svým vztahem k zinečnatým iontům unikátní. Fyziologicky dochází v prostatě až k desetinásobné akumulaci těchto iontů. Nádorově změněná tkáň však schopnost akumulace zinku postrádá a jeho koncentrace se výrazně snižuje. Tento projekt je zaměřen na odhalení vlivu zinečnatých iontů na viabilitu, životní funkce a výživu zvířat a dále na testování zinek rezisteních prostatických nádorových linií a jejich migrační a invazivní potenciál. Řešením tohoto projektu se umožní další rozvoj a poznání v problematice transportu a metabolismu zinečnatých iontů zejména u agresivních forem karcinomu prostaty s možným návrhem cíleného terapeutického zásahu.",

Tato odpověď funguje jako složitá síť, ve které paralelně spolupracují alternativní a často redundantní dráhy. Nedávné studie ukázaly, že částečné narušení této sítě v nádorové buňce vede k závislosti buňky na jediné DNA opravné dráze. Toho lze potenciálně využít při hledání terapie, která je cíleně zaměřená na dráhy zapojené v DDR. Znalost redundance těchto drah může být obzvláště důležitá u nádorových buněk, kde je možné využít přístup tzv. „syntetické letality“ (SL). Cílem projektu je: i) na základě dat získaných v kvasinkách předpovědět SL interakce v lidských buňkách; ii) potvrdit nové SL interakce s využitím siRNA/shRNA nebo buněk postrádajících některý z důležitých proteinů zapojených doDDR; iii) cíleně narušit vybrané SL interakce  již známými, nebo nově navrženými inhibitory. Výsledky tohoto výzkumu poskytnou nový přístup v léčbě nádorů s narušenými opravnými mechanismy DNA, který bude mít minimální vedlejší účinky na organismus.",

Projekt cílí na podporu přímé spolupráce výzkumníků a pracovníků v oblasti TT a umožňuje tak vytvořit společnou „komercializační strukturu“ pro každou klíčovou aktivitu projektu. To představuje významný zvrat v procesu řízení a realizace TT aktivit na MU, kdy lze mnohem efektivněji usměrňovat nejen zdokonalování vybraných výstupů - vytvoření Proof of Concept (PoC), ale s mnohem větší podporou a zájmem výzkumníků realizovat činnosti související s komercializací těchto výstupů. Díky projektu tak dojde nejen k efektivnímu využití již zavedené a funkční struktury pro transfer technologií na MU (existující  CTT, jehož vybrané aktivity jsou do r. 2015 podporovány z projektu OP VaVpI 3.3. „TT na MU“), ale k jejímu významnému systémovému i funkčnímu rozvoji.\n\nProjekt BioTechMed umožňuje realizovat činnosti TT na MU v daleko širším měřítku, než doposud.

Několik unikátních a nadějných výstupů dostává jedinečnou šanci, k tomu, aby směřovaly k reálnému využití.\n\nVytvořená komercializační struktura bude z dlouhodobého hlediska základem pro další obdobné aktivity.",

   "annotation": "Lymeská borrelióza je multisystémové bakteriální onemocnění, které neléčené může mít vážný dopad na kvalitu života pacientů. Problémem správné diagnostiky lymeské borreliózy je nízká spolehlivost sérologických testů a z ní vyplývající nízká specificita laboratorní diagnostiky.\nFalešně pozitivní výsledky vedou k tomu, že pacienti trpící nemocemi s podobnými symptomy mohou být nesprávně léčeni. Naopak v některých případech, kdy lékař správně vyhodnotí, že pacient touto nemocí netrpí a potíže souvisejí spíše s jiným onemocněním nebo jsou psychosomatického nebo imunologického rázu, pacient diagnózu neakceptuje a vzniká mezi ním a lékařem napětí. Hlavním cílem předkládaného projektu je řešit diagnostiku v širších souvislostech pomocí týmu odborníků z řad strukturních biologů, lékařů z infekčních klinik, imunologů, praktických lékařů, bioinformatiků, statistiků, ale také psychologů a sociologů. V projektu chceme využít jedinečnou možnost nabízené platformy Masarykovy univerzity sdružující zúčastněné týmy. \nCílem projektu je zpřesnění procesu při stanovení diagnózy v dimenzi biologické, ale také psychologické a sociální. Je třeba, aby si pacient v návaznosti na jeho osobní situaci vytvořil pozitivní vazbu důvěry ke svému zdravotnickému zařízení, aby nabyl jistoty, že péče, které se mu dostává je komplexní a nejlepší, jakou může dostat. Toho chceme dosáhnout nejen zdokonalením diagnostických testů na molekulární úrovni, kdy budeme sledovat strukturu a typ borreliových antigenů v čase (při vzniku a v průběhu nemoci), a změny sérologického profilu pacienta v různých fázích onemocnění, ale také zavedením psychologických testů specifických pro tuto nemoc. Vedle zlepšení diagnostických metod chceme přispět k vyšší úrovni znalostí o této nemoci nejen u praktických lékařů, ale také u laické veřejnosti vytvořením výukového rámce pro jejich vzdělávání. Současně se také chceme aktivně zapojit do tvorby celoevropských doporučení pro diagnostiku a léčbu lymeské borreliózy v rámci European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) – pracovní skupina ESGBOR (Study Group for Lyme Borreliosis).",

Navrhovatelé předpokládají možnost využít termovizní techniky při hodnocení revaskularizace dolních končetin jako rovnocenné náhrady za metody Ankle Brachial Index ABI či transkutánního kyslíku. Realizace projektu má vést k zavedení termovizní techniky do oblasti vyšetření diabetických pacientů, v tomto konkrétním případě zejména s ohledem na prováděné operativní revaskularizace na pracovišti II. chirurgické kliniky U Svaté Anny.\nSoučasně je cílem vytvoření edukačního programu zaměřeného na specifické cílové skupiny s náplní prevence onemocnění diabetes mellitus a komplikací s tímto onemocněním spojených, zejména s důrazem na minimalizaci výskytu syndromu diabetické nohy.

Maximální efektivity bude dosaženo propojením tvorby edukačních materiálů odborníky z Pedagogické fakulty MU v součinnosti a za podpory lékařů a pracovníků Lékařské fakulty MU. Inovativním elementem v procesu tvorby edukačních materiálů a edukace pacientů bude zapojení termovizní techniky jakožto jedné z nemnoha možných zobrazovacích metod umožňujících přímé zobrazení projevů symptomů syndromu diabetické nohy, využité v projektu jako zpětné vazby při procesu komunikace lékaře s pacienty. Specifičnost projektu je dána přímým propojením klinického pracoviště, teoretického pracoviště a edukačního centra. Aktuálnost tohoto tématu dokazují statistické údaje, vykazující vzrůstající trend výskytu diabetes mellitus. Během následujících deseti let bude překročena hodnota 10 procent populace ČR postižených tímto onemocněním.",

Téma inkluze bude řešeno jako interdisciplinární problém, což umožní řešitelům jeho komplexní uchopení bez limitu oborovosti. Inkluzivní vzdělávání není jen problémem pedagogickým nebo speciálněpedagogickým, ale týká se celé řady vědních oborů – psychologie, lékařství a sociologie. Výzkumný projekt bude řešen nově vzniklým konsorciem šesti spolupracujících výzkumných týmů ze tří fakult MU (PdF, LF a FF). Zaměříme na vzdělávací politiku a kritické analýze podrobíme relevantní národní a mezinárodní dokumenty a další zdroje. Dále nás bude zajímat perspektiva organizačně řídící – budeme se věnovat strategiím řízení školy jako instituce a organizace, ve které inkluze probíhá. Pedagogicko-didaktické hledisko uplatníme v další části výzkumu. V této oblasti se zaměříme na výchovu a vzdělávání žáků se speciálními vzdělávacími potřebami v základní škole. Z perspektivy speciálněpedagogické budeme zkoumat možnosti inkluze žáků s narušenou komunikační schopností, se sluchovým, mentálním, tělesným a kombinovaným postižením. V rámci zkoumání inkluze ve škole z hlediska medicínského se budeme věnovat zdravotním předpokladům a kompetencím žáků z perspektivy teoretické i klinické medicíny. Při zkoumání psychologických aspektů inkluze budou předmětem zkoumání souvislosti inkluze a kvality života. V rámci sociologické perspektivy budeme zkoumat sociální participaci jedinců se zdravotním postižením jako indikátor úspěšné inkluze.\nInterdisciplinární výzkum inkluze ve škole nebyl v českém prostředí dosud proveden. Činnost výzkumných týmů nebude probíhat izolovaně, ale využijeme řady mezioborových synergií. Výsledkem bude komplexní poznání toho, jaké podmínky je nutné vytvořit pro úspěšné inkluzivní vzdělávání. Ve výše uvedeném spatřujeme také inovativnost a originalitu projektu.\nVýzkumným prostředím budou běžné základní školy realizující inkluzivní vzdělávání. Využijeme standardní postupy sociálně vědního a medicínského výzkumu. Výsledky budeme prezentovat v kolektivních monografiích (7), v předních odborných časopisech (12) a v řadě výstupů na významných národních a mezinárodních konferencích.

   "annotation": "Léčba hematoonkologických onemocnění (HON) se projevuje řadou vedlejších účinků, které zhoršují kvalitu života pacientů. Nejčastějším vedlejším efektem je enormní únava, která provází pacienta obvykle od začátku onemocnění, zhoršuje se v průběhu terapie a může přetrvávat i roky po jejím úspěšném ukončení. Jedna z hlavních příčin této únavy pramení ze snížené celkové zdatnosti (=dekondice), která je dána zpravidla negativní změnou poměru aktivní tělesné hmoty vůči tukové složce a poklesu pohybové aktivity (PA), ať již v důsledku onemocnění jako takového nebo agresivní terapie. Ukazuje se, že únava provázející maligní onemocnění má negativní vztah k celkové aktivitě autonomního nervového systému (ANS), zejména k aktivitě vagu. Spektrální analýzou (SA) variability srdeční frekvence (HRV) lze neinvazivně posoudit funkční stav ANS. Je známo, že pravidelné cvičení zvyšuje jednak tělesnou zdatnost, jednak způsobuje pozitivní změny ANS, a to jak u nemocných, tak i u zdravých osob. Přestože existují nepochybné důkazy o pozitivním vlivu PA na celkový průběh řady onkologických onemocnění, je překvapivé, že i v rámci odborné podpůrné péče není příliš doporučována. Aplikaci PA u hematoonkologických pacientů, kteří tvoří v rámci onkologie specifickou podskupinu nemocných, ztěžuje výrazné postižení produkce krevních elementů poruchy krevního srážení a také snížení výkonnosti imunitního systému; dosavadní těžiště léčby leží výlučně v podání chemoterapie. Z těchto důvodů jsou v současné době k dispozici pouze velmi obecné pokyny k preskripci pohybové aktivity a rehabilitace u pacientů s HON. Z tohoto důvodu je velmi žádoucí další klinický interdisciplinární výzkum, na jehož základě by bylo možno vytvořit směrnice pro preskripce programu PA, které by bylo možno implementovat do standardních klinických onkologických postupů. Výzkum této oblasti a tvorba bezpečných a účinných tréninkových programů představují poměrně složitý mezioborový úkol, jehož řešení se systematicky věnuje i ve světě pouze několik málo pracovišť. Na jeho řešení je bezpodmínečná úzká spolupráce jak specialistů hematoonkologů tak specialistů v oboru fyzioterapie i tělesné výchovy a sportu.",

   "annotation": "Mnohočetný myelom (MM) je krevní nádorové onemocnění postihující většinou osoby nad 65 let. I přes obrovský pokrok v léčbě MM většina pacientů relabuje. Minimální residuální choroba (MRD, minimal residual disease) je stav, kdy u pacientů v klinické remisi stále přetrvávají klonogenní buňky, jejichž proliferace vede ke klinickému relapsu. Současné přístupy pro zhodnocení přítomnosti nádorových buněk jsou založeny na morfologickém hodnocení vzorku kostní dřeně a elektroforetických metodách. Většinou standardních metod jsou tyto klonogenní buňky nezachytitelné, ale včasný záchyt by měl přímý vliv na přežívání pacientů. V současné době se k detekci MRD využívá flow cytometrie a PCR, které mají uplatnění pro zjištění účinnosti léčby, porovnání efektivity různých léčebných strategií, monitorování pacientů a relapsu onemocnění. Detekce MRD pomocí PCR využívá amplifikace tumor-specifického molekulárního markeru. U MM je tímto markerem přestavba těžkého řetězce imunoglobulinu, kdy sekvence hypervariabilní oblasti tohoto imunoglobulinu slouží pro návrh primerů a sond specifických pro pacienty, které jsou pak v následné PCR reakci schopny detekovat přítomnost MRD s citlivostí až 10-6. Cílem předkládaného projektu je zavedení této metody v naší laboratoři.",

V rámci řešení projektu specifického výzkumu budou adresována témata relevantní těmto základním potřebám.  Zejména budou studovány molekulární mechanismy zodpověděné za genovou nestabilitu lidských embryonálních kmenových (hES) buněk a lidských indukovaných pluripotentních kmenových (hiPS) buněk, budou vyvíjeny protokoly diferenciace hES buněk do odontogenních a plicní epiteliálních linií, a budou vyvíjeny biomimetické povrchy schopné podporovat nediferencovaný růst hES buněk a jejich diferenciaci.  Hlavními experimentálními přístupy budou in vitro manipulace s buňkami, zobrazování živých buněk, fixovaných buněk a fixovaných tkání sofistikovanými mikroskopickými technikami, a také molekulární fenotypizace buněčných populací kvantifikací relevantních mRNA a proteinů.

Tyto buňky produkují monoklonální imunoglobuliny a další cytokiny, které jsou příčinou klinických příznaků MM. Světově toto onemocnění tvoří 10 % všech hematologických malignit. Nestin je protein VI. třídy intermediálních filament, původně identifikován jako marker neuroepiteliálních kmenových/progenitorových buněk v centrálním nervovém systému v mozku myší. Za normálních podmínek je exprimován v nediferencovaných tkáních; buňky, které nestin vylučují, mají charakteristické znaky kmenových buněk – multipotence, sebeobnova a regenerace. Po diferenciaci tkání je hladina nestinu snížena a nestin je nahrazen jinými intermediálními filamenty. Hladina nestinu se může znovu zvýšit po zranění nebo jiných patologických stavech. Dnes je známo, že nestin má významnou roli při karcinogenezi – jeho exprese souvisí se stupněm diferenciace některých solidních nádorů. V naší laboratoři jsme se zaměřili na studium nestinu v patogenezi mnohočetného myelomu. Předkládaný projekt se zaměří na objasnění in vitro role nestinu na myelomové linie a jeich proliferaci, apoptózu, buněčný cyklus ale i migraci.",

Základním cílem projektu v roce 2013 bude studium šíření signálních molekul z distálního pahýlu poškozeného nervu, které mohou vyvolat vznik neurozánětu ve vzdálených struktur nervové soustavy. Z našich a publikovaných experimentálních výsledků klinických studií vyplývá, že po poškození periferního nervu vznikají projevy neurozánětu ve spinálních gangliích, kořenech spinálních nervů a následně i zadních rozích šedé hmoty míchy. Zánětlivé reakce ve vzdálených nervových strukturách mohou výrazně přispívat k vytvoření dysbalance v aferentaci, která je považována za jeden z mechanizmů vzniku neuropatické bolesti.\nPředpokládáme, že přes porušenou hemato-nervovou bariérou se signální molekuly dostanou do cirkulující krve a přes hemato-likvorovou bariéru do likvoru a tím ke vzdáleným nervovým strukturám.

Distribuce tracerů bude sledována fluorescenčním mikroskopem ve spinálních gangliích a míšních segmentech L4-L5, které anatomicky souvisí a také v segmentech C7-C8, které nemají anatomické spojení s n. ischiadicus. Dále bude distribuce tracerů sledována v buňkách krevního nátěru a v plexus choroideus komor CNS.

Půjde přitom o aplikaci metod molekulárně-biologických, molekulárně-genetických a metod buněčné biologie. Na výzkumu se budou podílet samostatné vědecké týmy Biologického ústavu LF MU disponujícími odlišnými výzkumnými tématy a nástroji, které budou mít vědeckou kvalitu minimálně evropské úrovně a současně potenciál pro navazující translační lékařský výzkum, tak jak je provozován v rámci LF MU.\n\nDalšími, neméně důležitými cíly tohoto projektu bude vědecká výchova magisterských a doktorských studentů pro práci v klíčových výzkumných oblastech a s důrazem na ovládnutí moderních výzkumných a diagnostických technik. Důraz bude kladen na technicky náročnou výchova přímo ve výzkumných laboratořích spojenou se zvládnutím a rozvojem moderních výzkumných postupů a vzájemným předáváním laboratorních zkušeností, dovedností a znalostí. Studenti budou také vedeni k přípravě a plánování experimentální práce  a  analýzy a interpretace vědeckých výsledků. Budou také vedeni ke zlepšení ve schopnostech prezentovat své výsledky odborné i laické veřejnosti.",

Projekt se zabývá: 1. Sledováním aktivity ES v animálních modelech metamfetaminové závislosti a deprese jako její komorbidity; 2. Rolí ES v regulaci metabolické aktivity cytochromu P450 a dopady na farmakokinetiku léčiv. Depresivní onemocnění je spojováno s vyšší vulnerabilitou k látkovým závislostem. Proto byla popsána teorie tzv. sebeléčení jako možné vysvětlení časté komorbidity deprese a drogové závislosti, kdy se pacient pokouší ulevit depresivním příznakům užíváním návykové látky. Náš tým za účelem zkoumání vzájemných interakcí deprese a drogové závislosti vyvinul a validoval animální (potkaní) model této komorbidity, kde je depresivní onemocnění navozeno modelem olfaktorické bulbektomie a metamfetaminová závislost metodou operantní autoaplikace. Tento model je určen k testování léčiv a experimentálních látek, u nichž existuje racionální podklad pro hypotézu možného ovlivnění průběhu drogové závislosti. Dalším významným faktorem ovlivňujícím účinek návykových látek jsou farmakokinetické vlastnosti a interakce drog, případně změna jejich farmakokinetiky vyvolaná endokanabinoidní regulací. Cytochrom P450 (CYP) patří mezi nejdůležitější biotransformační enzymatické systémy. Metabolická aktivita CYP je ovlivněna mnoha faktory, jako jsou pohlaví, věk, genetický polymorfismus a xenobiotika. Interindividuální rozdíly v aktivitě CYP, způsobují odlišnou rychlost metabolizace léčiv mezi jednotlivými pacienty a mohou hrát významnou roli v bezpečnosti a účinnosti podávaných látek. Podle nejnovějších údajů je metabolická aktivita CYP regulována také centrálním mechanismem skrze ovlivnění dopaminergního systému. Zapojení endokanabinoidního systému v neuroregulaci aktivity CYP nebylo ale podle dostupné literatury dosud studováno a prokázáno.",

Původními kandidáty implantace byli nemocní, kteří prodělali maligní arytmii a většinou byli resuscitováni pro zástavu oběhu. Od roku 1996, kdy byla publikována data primárně preventivní studie MADIT se začal zvyšovat počet primárně preventivních (PP) indikací, kdy byl defibrilátor implantován i  nemocným, kteří dosud maligní arytmii neprodělali. V současné praxi je kandidátem ICD každý pacient s ejekční frakcí levé komory (EFLK) <35% se známkami srdečního selhání. Výsledkem je pokles efektivity ICD terapie a nárůst její ceny.

Cíle tohoto projektu vycházejí z nových pilotních dat, která ukazují srovnatelnou reaktivitu mezi populacemi αβ a γδ T lymfocytů u zdravých dárců. γδ T lymfocyty bez MHC-restrikce detekce antigenů mají v budoucnu velký potenciál pro klinické aplikace a naše výsledky přispějí k objasnění úlohy γδ buněk a jejich anti-CMV reaktivity, což může být využito následně v cílené léčbě.",

Preto je znalosť regulačných mechanizmov riadiacich aktivitu tohoto enzymatického systému kľúčová pre úspešnú a bezpečnú farmakoterapiu. Bolo dokázané, že aktivita CYP je ovplyvňovaná dopaminergným systémom respektíve hormónmi, ktorých uvoľňovanie je týmto systémom  riadené. Zmeny hormonálnych hladín boli popísané aj u rôznych  patologických stavov vrátane depresie. Žiadna práca nepopisuje či samotné ochorenie je schopné zmeniť aktivitu CYP. Cieľom projektu je zistiť, či preklinický model depresie - olfaktorickej bulbektómie u potkana, mení metabolickú aktivitu cytochrómu P450 (CYP).",

Výsledkem epigenetických změn (případně jejich kombinace s genetickými změnami) je změněný fenotyp příslušné buňky. Naše výzkumná skupina identifikovala genetickou variabilitu v promotoru RAGE genu jako rizikový faktor diabetické nefropatie. Tato asociace byla později prokázána i v dalších populacích. Předpokládáme, že podobně jako jiné prozánětlivé geny je i exprese genu RAGE regulována také pomocí epigenetických mechanizmů.

   "annotation": "Evproská společnost pro klinickou mikrobiologii a infekční nemoci (ESCMID) a její ESCMID Study Group for Biofilm jsou světově uznávané organizace sdružující klinické mikrobiology, lékaře, infektology a další vědeckovýzkumné pracovníky na poli mikrobiologie. ESGB se pak zaměřuje na problematiku biofilmu, a to ve všech jeho aspektech – v klinicko-medicínských, průmyslových i přírodních souvislostech. Úzká spolupráce a propojení ESGB s European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases nám umožňuje získat podporu na výzkumné i vzdělávací projekty věnující se problematice biofilmu. Pokračování naší aktivní práce ve výkonném výboru ESCMID Study Group for Biofilm přinese České republice významný užitek a povede k posílení dobrého jména České republiky nejen v rámci Evropy, ale i světově.\nDíky pokračující práci zástupců České republiky v ESGB a tedy zapojení ČR do evropského dění v problematice klinické mikrobiologie a mikrobiálního biofilmu budeme mít možnost ovlivňovat vznik a obsah tzv. \"standardů péče\" (podrobněji viz dále) a doporučených postupů léčby (tzv. guidelines) a dalších směrnic nejen v problematice mikrobiálního biofilmu. Aktivní prací vědeckých pracovníků v mezinárodně uznávaných odborných společnostech stoupá prestiž nejen jednotlivých pracovišť, ale celé České republiky, jako země podporující mezinárodní spolupráci. Aktivní prací vědeckých pracovníků z ČR zapojených do organizačních a odborných pozic ESGB získáme rovněž možnost spolupodílet se na směřování a rozvoji studia problematiky biofilmu.\nCílem předkládaného projektu je podpora zastoupení českých vědců ve výkonném výboru odborné mezinárodní společnosti ESCMID Study Group for Biofilm, čímž projekt napomáhá získávání kontaktů a navazování spolupráce se zahraničními pracovišti a podporuje reprezentaci České republiky v zahraničí.

EKG, kontinuální záznam krevního tlaku, sfygmografický záznam) a vícerozměrných (ultrazvuk) signálů. Jednou z otázek, kterou může tato studie zodpovědět je, zda snížená schopnost baroreflexní regulace krevního tlaku (BRS) u hypertoniků je primární či sekundární. Předpokládáme, že hlavně u mladých hypertoniků může převládat genetická determinace, jejíž podíl se postupně s věkem hypertoniků bude zmenšovat. Naopak u starší populace bude pravděpodobně snížená BRS hlavně sekundárního původu a to z důvodu ztráty poddajnosti arteriální stěny, kde se nacházejí baroreceptory. S hodnocením tuhosti tepen a hypertenzí jsou v poslední době úzce spojovány parametry odvozené z centrální aortální křivky (CABP). Bohužel tyto parametry jsou odvozovány složitými matematickými přepočty z křivek periferních tepen s pravděpodobnosti zanesení chyby. Proto neninvazivní stanovení centrální CABP přímo z aorty je velmi žádoucí. Tyto nově vyvinuté metodiky spolu s genetickou analýzou mohou přinést nové informace o genetické i negenetické podmíněnosti poruch krátkodobé regulace krevního tlaku, které se vyskytuji u osob s vysokým krevním tlakem.",

Půjde zejména o vyšetření determinant kódujících bakteriociny, dále také vybrané virulenční faktory a fylogenetické skupiny. U vybraných kmenů E. coli bude provedena detailnější charakterizace pomocí  multilokusové sekvenční analýzy, analýzy celkové plasmidové DNA, pulsotypizace pulsní elektroforézou a v několika případech i  pomocí celogenomové sekvenace, což umožní srovnat izoláty z ČR s kmeny izolovanými jinde ve světě.  Naše předběžné výsledky ukazují překvapivé rozdíly ve výskytu bakteriocinogenních kmenů E. coli izolovaných od pacientů s CD a UC.

Údaje o změnách těchto proudů v přítomnosti ethanolu a jeho metabolitu acetaldehydu jsou, bohužel, velmi omezené a v případě IK1 i kontroverzní. Naše nedávné pilotní pokusy odhalily signifikantní nárůst IK1 pod vlivem 0,92‰ ethanolu u komorových srdečních buněk potkana. Tento projekt jsme proto zaměřili na podrobnou analýzu vlivu ethanolu a acetaldehydu na IK1 a IK(Ach) metodou whole cell patch clamp u izolovaných srdečních buněk potkana/morčete a u lidských kanálů přechodně exprimovaných na buněčné linii z ovariálních buněk čínského křečka. Za pomoci matematických modelů srdečních buněk potkana, morčete a člověka budeme pozorované změny IK1 a IK(Ach) konfrontovat se změnami průběhu akčního napětí.

Projekt předpokládá prozkoumání účinku lignanů na sérii rezistentních buněčných linii, jejichž rezistence je dána zvýšenou expresí ABC transportérů, jako je P-glykoprotein. Experimenty budou zaměřeny na izolaci lignanů z rostliny Schisandra chinensis podle jejich schopnosti zvýšit akumulaci cytostatika doxorubicinu v rezistentních nádorových buňkách se zvýšenou expresí P-glykoproteinu a schopnosti obnovit cytotoxický efekt protinádorových léčiv na rezistentní nádorové buňky. Mechanizmus účinku aktivních lignanů bude studován podrobněji. Aktivitou řízená izolace lignanů z rostlinného materiálu a jejich semisynteticka modifikace, včetně přípravy enantiomerů, umožní získáni aktivnějších derivátů a nalezeni vztahu mezi strukturou a účinkem.",

Jednotlivé části projektu se zabývají různými možnými mechanismy působení MTX: (1) inhibice syntézy nukleových kyselin (hodnocení změn proliferace a buněčného cyklu; bude porovnávána účinnost high-dose MTX v kombinaci s antidotem leukovorinem vs. low-dose MTX bez leukovorinu); (2) inhibice metylace DNA (detekce změn metylace genů RAR signální dráhy ve vztahu k ATRA-indukované buněčné diferenciaci); (3) inhibice histondeacetyláz (stanovení acetylace histonů a porovnání účinku se známými inhibitory). Dosažené výsledky mohou přinést nové poznatky o mechanismech působení MTX, což by mohlo (po jejich dalším ověření ve studiích fáze I a II) následně vést v klinické praxi k aplikacím nižší dávky léčiva při stejném terapeutickém efektu.",

Prvotní příčina nádorové transformace vedoucí k MM není známá, nicméně je patrné, že opětovné vstoupení B-lymfocytů do buněčného cyklu a jeho progrese nastává v rané fázi onkogeneze a je příčinou expanze monoklonálních myelomových buněk.  Byly popsány dvě rané dráhy patogeneze MM, hyperdiploidní (HRD) a nonhyperidloidní  (NHRD). Obě dráhy vedou v konečném důsledku ke genetickým aberacím cyklinů D, které následně deregulují G1/S bod restrikce, jenž je v myelomových buňkách často poškozen. Umlčení exprese genů pro cykliny D pomocí shRNA spojené s profilováním genové exprese a následná systematická analýza signálních drah umožní stanovení účinku cyklinů D na skupinu genů a následné odlišení genů regulovaných přímo cykliny D od sekundárních jevů.",

Řešitelský tým zde navrhuje unikátní přístup - kombinaci standardní léčby, zahrnující chirurgickou resekci nádoru, radioterapii a podávání temozolomidu, s vakcinací dendritickými buňkami (DB) silně produkujícími interleukin (IL)-12. V navrhované akademické klinické studii fáze II budou pacienti randomizováni v poměru 1:1 do skupiny se standardní léčbou, nebo do skupiny se standardní léčbou a vakcinací DB. Hlavním cílem projektu je zhodnotit bezpečnost a případnou toxicitu takovéto kombinované léčby, a vyhodnotit potenciál DB pro navození dlouhodobé remise onemocnění. DB jsou připravovány v Čistých prostorách Masarykovi university, jediném akademickém pracovišti v České republice, které má povolení Státního ústavu pro kontrolu léčiv k výrobě DB pro klinické použití. Tento projekt je unikátní jak v České republice, tak v Evropě, protože u GBM kombinuje standardní léčebný postup s moderním přístupem buněčné imunoterapie. Vakcinace dendritickými buňkami produkujícími IL-12 jako součást kombinované terapie by se do budoucna mohla stát novým standardem v léčbě GBM, a případně i dalších typů nádorových onemocnění. Tento projekt tak významnou měrou přispívá do resortního programu výzkumu a vývoje III v programu 03 Onkologie, neboť se jedná o využití výsledků vlastního výzkumu a jejich realizaci v klinické praxi.",

   "annotation": "Cílem je vybudování centra pro výuku intervenční radiologie MU s nadregionálním působením. Intervenční radiologie jako subspecializace radiologie za posledních 15 let překonala enormní rozvoj, nicméně v pregraduální výuce a rovněž v postgraduální výuce má stále minimální podíl neodpovídající významu. Techniky intervenční radiologie přesahují obor, obrazem naváděné výkony bohatě využívají i gastroenterologové, kardiologové i obory chirurgické. Předpokládáme grantovou podporu ve výši 1,70 mil., která bude využita k nákupu elektronického fantomu pro nácvik vaskulárních intervencí, silikonového fantomu s nuceným oběhem tekutiny pro nácvik vaskulárních intervencí a modelu pro ex vivo nácvik punkčních biopsií. Výsledkem bude zkvalitnění praktické výuky v rámci pregraduálního studia, nácvik techniky výkonů pro postgraduální studenty MU v rámci přípravy na atestace z obecné i intervenční radiologie, příprava na evropské zkoušky intervenční radiologie (EBIR). Při výuce předpokládáme spolupráci dalších oborů. Praktické modelování intervencí bude předpokladem k vědecké práci postgraduálních studentů.",

Projekt je zaměřen na výzkum účinků nanomateriálů v podobě metalických nanočástic v součinnosti s aplikací ultrazvukového pole na lidské nádorové buněčné linie. Smyslem realizace projektu je nalezení podmínek a metodiky pro lokální zesílení protinádorového účinku metalických nanočástic in vitro díky přitomnosti ultrazvukového pole a získání nových vědomostí o tomto procesu. Z dosavadních výsledků provedených experimentů vyplívá, že přítomností ultrazvukového pole jsou významně ovlivněny buněčné struktury a jejich prostupnost pro makromolekuly. Lze se domnívat, že tento efekt povede k větší intracelulární koncentraci nanočástic a k posílení výsledného cytostatického efektu. S ohledem na tuto skutečnost se zdá být perspektivní provést komplexnější výzkum, zahrnující různé typy nádorových linií v interakci s vybranými nanostrukturamy a vhodným uspořádáním ultrazvukového pole.",

Praktikum má za cíl analýzu polymorfismů v lidských genech kódujících Toll-like receptory (TLR) a manózu vázající lektin (MBL), které modifikují citlivost člověka k infekčním chorobám. Zavedení praktika s real-time PCR (jako jedné z moderních technik, umožňujících rychle zjistit relevantní genotyp pacientů) je krokem ukazujícím cestu k budoucí personalizované medicíně. Současně tato výuka přispěje k lepší orientaci vystudovaných lékařů v paletě moderních laboratorních metod a jejich využití v klinické praxi. V těchto dvou cvičeních bude využíván termocykler pro real-time PCR, spektrofotometr, chlazená centrifuga a výrobník ledu. Potřebné reagencie a spotřební materiál pro tato cvičení budou hrazeny z rozpočtu Biologického ústavu. Cílovou skupinou tohoto projektu bude pro každý akademický rok více než 700 pregraduálních studentů oborů Všeobecné lékařství, Zubní lékařství a Biomedicínská technika a bioinformatika v rámci předmětů Biologie a Úvod do molekulární biologie a genetiky.",

Naše předběžné výsledky ukazují, že genetické formy T. pallidum jsou odlišné v různých místech světa. Znalost variant kmenů T. pallidum je zásadní pro pochopení vzniku a evoluce těchto patogenů. Druhým hlavním cílem projektu je identifikace a bližší specifikace kmenů T. pallidum, které vykazují odlišnosti od typických kmenů T. pallidum. Přesný popis podobných kmenů je velmi významný z hlediska mapování evoluce patogenních treponem. Mapování genetické variability T. pallidum je navíc základ pro návrh nových nebo zdokonalených typovacích schémat, je tedy předstupněm detailnějších epidemiologických studií. Navázání kontaktů mezi českým a argentinským týmem je nezbytné z důvodů analýzy DNA izolované z klinických vzorků.",

Cílovou skupinou jsou studenti LF a PedF MU, akademiční pracovíci a další pracovníci zabývající se vzděláváním, výzkumem a vývojem, kteří pečují o děti a mládež s poruchami komunikace a též studenti MU s poruchami komunikace. Pracovníci obou pracovišť pečují denně o děti a mládež s poruchami komunikace, ale jsou vyškoleni a vzděláni hlavně ve svých konkrétních specializacích. Mnozí nemají dostatečné povědomí o práci svých kolegů. Jsme přesvědčení, že péče o děti a mládež s poruchami komunikace má být komplexní a toho lze dosáhnou zlepšením  komunikace, vzájemným předáváním poznatků a vytvořením stabilní partnerské sétě mezi všemi zaintersovanými subjekty.",

V takto vytvořené síti bude hlavním cílem vzájemné předávání zkušeností, informací a dovedností při řešení konkrétního projektu na modelovém území v Etiopii (tréninkový praktický modul TPM). TPM bude zaměřen na trvale udržitelné hospodaření v katastru vybrané obce v regionu Awasa silně postiženého erozí, s naprosto nedostatečným podílem trvalé dřevinné vegetace, s nedostatečně řešenými vodními zdroji a extenzívními zemědělskými systémy.  Řešení v příloze popsaného TPM bude ideální a velmi účinnou platformou pro vzájemné mezioborové předávání zkušeností, které jednotliví partneři využijí ke zkvalitnění vlastní činnosti. Při společném řešení TPM budou jednotliví partneři zodpovědní za dílčí odborná témata, při nichž budou aplikovat aktuální vědecké výsledky a moderní postupy a s nimiž tak seznámí ostatní partnery. Dojde tak přirozeně k lepšímu přenosu a využití výsledků výzkumu a vývoje do praxe a z praxe do výuky. Kromě výše popsaného společného komplexního řešení modelového projektu bude prohlubována vzájemná komunikace mezi partnery formou stáží, školení a seminářů, vydávání výukových materiálů či společného publikování vybraných výsledků. Důraz bude kladen i na zahraniční spolupráci, jak přímo v Etiopii, tak se subjekty v Evropě či USA, které se zabývají podobnou tématikou, zde zejména formou stáží.Řešitel z LF bude v projektu zodpovědný za problematiku výživy obyvatel s přesahem do produkce potravin a etnobotaniky. Konkrétní formou zapojení do projektu bude konzultační činnost a pravidelná účast realizačního týmu na stážích, odborných praxích, seminářích a jiných aktivitách. Výsledkem bude návrh metodiky a optimální formy spolupráce při vytváření strategií udržitelného využití krajiny zemí tropů a subtropů.",

Tato fáze bude probíhat pod vedením referenčního centra pro závislé na tabáku při 1. LF UK a VFN Praha. Podstatná je zde účast zahraničních odborníků v této fázi projektu, kteří zajistí přenos nových poznatků ze zahraničí.

Základním cílem projektu v roce 2012 je studium aktivace gliových buněk, invaze makrofágů a exprese vybraných pro- a protizánětlivých cytokinů a jejich receptorů v kořenech spinálních nervů na experimentálních modelech poškození periferního nervu. Z publikovaných experimentálních a klinických studií vyplývá, že po poškození periferního nervu vznikají projevy neurozánětu ve spinálních gangliích a zadních rozích míchy, zatímco minimálně informací máme o těchto reakcích v kořenech spinálních nervů. Přitom kořeny spinálních nervů propojují spinální ganglia s míchou a jejich mechanické poškození nebo jen kontakt s vyhřezlým ncl. pulposus meziobratlové ploténky vyvolává u člověka intenzivní bolestivé stavy (sciatica). Lze proto předpokládat, že projevy neurozánětu po poškození periferního nervu, které se šíří do spinálních ganglií a dorzálních rohů míchy se budou projevovat i v míšních kořenech a mohou výrazně přispívat k vytvoření dysbalance v aferentaci, která je považována za jeden z mechanizmů vzniku neuropatické bolesti. \nExperimentální modely poškození nervu, které všeobecně slouží ke studiu jak regenerace axonů, tak vzniku neuropatické bolesti, jsou založeny na unilaterálním položení dvojité ligatury na n ischiadicus laboratorního potkana za sterilních podmínek. \nAktivace gliových buněk a invaze buněk imunitního systému bude sledována imunohistochemic-kou detekcí odpovídajících buněčných markerů (GFAP, ED1) a jejich kvantitativním vyhodnoce-ním pomocí analýzy obrazu ve spinálních kořenech, a to bilaterálně vzhledem k unilaterálnímu poškození nervu. Projevy neurozánětu a jeho šíření budou studovány imunohistochemickou detekcí proteinu vybraných cytokinů (TNFa, IL6) a jejich receptorů (TNFR1, TNFR2, IL6R, gp130) na buněčných strukturách spinálních kořenů.",

Ve stručnosti lze cíle charakterizovat následovně: optimalizace metod vyšetření, které přinášejí prognostické informace o průběhu nemoci, ale také predikční informace o účinnosti jednotlivých léčiv. Dalším cílem je optimalizace a zavedení nových metod k detekci infekčních patogenů, které tyto nemoci provázejí.",

   "annotation": "Ovariální karcinom (OC) je závažné onkogynekologické onemocnění s nejvyšší mortalitou mezi jinými onemocněními ženského reprodukčního systému. Sporadický OC představuje heterogenní skupinu nádorů s různou histologickou stavbou, odvozenou většinou z epitelu ovariálního povrchu. Karcinom prostaty (PCa) je nejčastějším nádorovým onemocněním mužského urogenitálního traktu, kde obvykle vzniká ze žlázového epitelu prostaty. Klinické projevy rozvoje nádorového postižení ovarií i prostaty jsou nespecifické a pozdní záchyt onemocnění výrazně komplikuje terapii a snižuje délku přežití. Stávající diagnostické a prognostické faktory využívané k odhadu vývoje onemocnění, zpřesnění diagnózy a optimalizaci klinických intervencí zahrnují zejména staging, grading a reziduální velikost tumoru po cytoreduktivním zákroku (OC), resp. Gleason score a přítomnost metastatických ložisek (PCa) ze sérových tumorových markerů potom zejména CA 125 (mucin 16) u ovariálního karcinomu a PSA (prostate serum antigen) u karcinomu prostaty. Přestože bylo do současné doby charakterizováno velké množství dalších kandidátních biomarkerů, zůstávají stále CA 125, resp. PSA základními diagnostickými a prediktivními faktory. Nicméně jejich zásadním nedostatkem je nízká diagnostická senzitivita, diskutabilní využití při detekci raných stádií a nízká schopnost dlouhodobé predikce. Problematika nových molekulárních markerů pro diagnostiku, monitoring a predikci rozvoje prostatických a ovariálních karcinomů je tak vysoce aktuální. Předchozí práce navrhovatelů ukázaly na potenciálně významné geny, jejichž exprese je deregulována v nádorových buňkách a které mají schopnost predikovat vývoj onemocnění. Geny/proteiny s charakterem biomarkerů také představují atraktivní cíl specifické biologické léčby. Tento projekt se na základě předchozích výsledků zaměřuje na detailní studium genů TUSC3 a GDF-15",

Abnormální metabolická situace v těhotenství negativně ovlivňuje (A) průběh a zakončení těhotenství a také (B) postnatální zdravotní stav resp. vyhlídky dítěte v důsledku „fetálního programování“ (zvyšuje riziko obesity a T2DM v pozdějším životě). Navíc, (C) GDM můžeme považovat za prediktor resp. pozitivní zátěžový test naznačující predispozici k pozdějšímu rozvoji permanentního DM. Konečně (D) GDM může být nahlížen jako “špička ledovce” protože podobné i když méně vyjádřené abnormality se mohou podílet na etiopatogenezi DM u žen obecně a tudíž GDM může napomoci osvětlení možných pohlavně specifických efektů při rozvoji DM. GDM lze tedy považovat za důležitý “metabolický vzkaz” zasluhující pozornost vzhledem k tomu, že o jeho etiopatogenezi mnoho nevíme. Navrhovaný projekt si klade za cíl studovat mechanismy zodpovědné za (1) rozvoj GDM a (2) jeho tranzici do permanentního DM po těhotenství.",

Jedním z největších problémů, kterým čelí použití hESC v klinické praxi je jejich adaptace na in vitro kultivační podmínky spojená s destabilizací genomu a případným onkogenním potenciálem transplantovaných buněk. Tento potenciál se však může projevit až přenosem hESC a od nich buněk odvozených do lidského in vivo prostředí aniž by se projevil v současných testech. Je také pravděpodobné, že adaptace by mohla být i za současnými neúspěchy klinických pokusů aplikace hESC, při kterých buňky aplikované pacientům ztratily svůj diferenciační potenciál, což ovšem opět není možné detekovat dostupnými technikami. Z hlediska onkogenního potenciálu je nejdůležitější schopnost hESC po transplantaci vytvořit buňky podobné těm z embryonálního karcinomu (EC-like). V tomto projektu se proto zaměříme na 1) stanovení vlivu adaptace a genomové stability na tvorbu teratomů a hlavně výskyt EC-like buněk, které jsou v současné době považovány za původ nebezpečí pocházejícího z klinického použití hESC a buněk z nich odvozených.

Sledovány budou zejména změny virové nálože parvoviru B19 v 6-měsíčním sledování ve skupinách a mezi skupinami nemocných s odlišnou léčbou včetně imunosupresivní, a to jednak u nemocných s DKMP a také ve skupině pacientů po srdeční transplantaci. Na podkladě znalosti výsledku EMB bychom chtěli identifikovat biomarkery v periferní krvi, které by umožnily neinvazivně rozlišit mezi dilatační a zánětlivou KMP. Jednalo by se o srovnání exprese mRNA v periferních leukocytech a v myokardu. Dále budou sledovány působky (zánětlivé parametry, zejména vybrané chemokiny a adhezivní molekuly, dále metaloproteinázy a jejich inhibitory), které se podílí na rozvoji remodelace a dysfunkce levé komory srdeční.",

Nedávno bylo zjištěno, že do mléka se uvolňuje řada tzv. adipokinů, látek vytvářených v tukové tkáni i mléčné žláze matky, které mají zároveň výrazné imunomodulační účinky u novorozence. K dispozici je ovšem pouze velmi málo informací o tom, jakým způsobem jsou adipokiny v mateřském mléce regulovány a jakým způsobem je řízena odpověď kojence na adipokiny v mateřském mléce, přičemž se dá očekávat, že se bude jednat o mechanismy epigenetické. Možné pojítko představují miRNA, které jsou do mateřského mléka uvolňovány a které mají potenciálně mohutné účinky na imunitní systém dítěte. V současnosti není k dispozici žádná studie, která by se zabývala dynamikou hladin miRNA v mateřském mléce vzhledem k hladinám specifických adipokinů, které jsou do mléka secernovány.\nCílem navrhovaného projektu je identifikace miRNA exprimovaných do mateřského mléka,  sledování dynamiky exprese miRNA v mateřském mléce/séru matky v časovém horizontu 1 roku po porodu, stanovení souvislostí s hladinami specifických adipokinů uvolňovaných do mateřského mléka a hledání možných predikčních markerů ze skupiny miRNA, které by bylo možné použít pro odhad vyššího/nižšího hmotnostního přírůstku novorozence-kojence v daném časovém období laktace.\nNavrhovaný projekt přispívá k řešení Resortního programu výzkumu a vývoje III Ministerstva zdravotnictví České republiky, programu 0.2 Poruchy metabolismu a výživy, endokrinní poruchy, diabetes mellitus (zejména Identifikace rizikových skupin ohrožených vznikem jmenovaných onemocnění, časná diagnostika subklinických forem onemocnění).",

Cílem projektu je studium druhového složení biofilmových společenstev kultivačně a molekulárními technikami a zhodnocení rozdílů v polymikrobiálních společenstvech ve vztahu k délce zavedení katétru, jeho druhu a dalším faktorům včetně druhů predominujících mikrobiální sukcesi.",

   "annotation": "Výuka studentů LF v oboru otorhinolaryngologie zahrnuje výuku na několika funkčních částech kliniky podle jejich zaměření. Praktická výuka dětské otorinolaryngologie má své značné specifika a obtíže. Ty spočívají jednak v nutnosti návazat kontakt a důvěru s dětským pacientem a jednak samotné vyšetřování, diagnostika a terapeutické zákroky probíhají v málo přehledných a obtížně dostupných lokalitách, což je dáno složitostí anatomie hlavy a krku. Praktická znalost prostorových a funkčních vztahů v oblasti ORL je nezbytná pro pochopení fyziologických a následně i patologických procesů zde probíhajících, tak aby student LF po absolvování předmětu ORL byl schopen tyto procesy vysvětlit a v praxi rozpoznat, obzvlástě proto, že problematika děstké ORL představuje značnou část onemocnění v dětském věku obecně. Počet studentů LF neustále narůstá a z výše uvedených skutečností vyplývá fakt, že se snižuje dostupnost praktické výuky pro konkrétního studenta v našem specifickém oboru. Proto jsme se rozhodli požádat o finanční prostředky z programu FRVŠ ve výši 1, 726.000,- Kč, které chceme využít na zakoupení zařízení potřebných k zajištění dostupnosti a zkvalitnění praktické výuky dětské ORL. Konkrétně se jedná o zakoupení speciální kamery, prezentačního 3DTV, které umožní nahrávaní a pořízení 3D snímků a filmů, což je v ORL oblasti unikátní možnost jak demonstrovat v praxi anatomické a funkční vztahy i patologické procesy. Dále chceme pořídít 3 demonstrační vyšetřovací mikroskopy, které mají speciální výstup pro video a umožňují přenos obrazu na LCD monitor, což je obzvlášť potřebné především při demonstraci vyšetřování v oblasti ucha.

   "annotation": "Připravovaná Laboratoř  virtuální výuky chirurgie využije možnosti propojení 3 základních rozhraní v chirurgii – diagnostiky,  topografické anatomie a chirurgického zákroku. Exkluzivitu laboratoře vidíme především v komplexnosti výuky chirurgie a to s využitím virtuálních prvků, jež skýtají moderní zobrazovací techniky v diagnostice. Důležitá je rovněž virtuální předoperační anatomická příprava a virtuální operační zákrok. Tím je myšlena i otázka operačního přístupu. Výuka se tak nebude omezovat pouze na operační léčbu, ale bude vycházet  z anatomie a patofyziologie jednotlivých onemocnění, precizní diagnostiky jednotlivých  chorob a operačních indikací. Patřičný důraz bude věnován moderním diagnostickým i operačním technikám s využitím miniinvazivních technik. \nZamýšlená laboratoř virtuální výuky by tak doplnila ve své komplexnosti stávající tři exkluzivní učebny na I.chirurgické klinice a to (1. Interaktivní laboratoř Miniinvazivní a robotické chirurgie, 2. Laboratoř nácviku praktických dovedností, 3. Multimediální výuková laboratoř).  Systematičnost a názornost výuky na I.chirurgické klinice je zcela v korelaci s požadavky moderní medicíny a získala i ocenění vedení Multioborového simulačního centra Mayo Clinic v Rochesteru při návštěvě FN USA v Brně.",

Předpokládáme, že ranné onkogenní změny ovlivňují různé fáze buněčného cyklu v patogenezi MM a dávají vznik dvěma drahám: nonhyperdiploidní (ovlivněné v G1 fázi) a hyperdiploidní (v G2/M fázi). Akumulace těchto změn vede k nádorové transformaci a dle typu k různému vývoji choroby. Předpokládáme, že současně v organismu existují různé myelomové subpopulace, které vytvářejí rezervoáry pro obnovu nádoru, jeho růst a šíření. Předpokládáme, že hlavní úlohu zde hrají B buňky jako platforma pro iniciační onkogenní změny v MM buňkách. MM je stále nevyléčitelná nemoc s nevyjasněnou a komplikovanou onkogenezí.

Dětské\nzubní lékařství bývalo dříve samostatnou specializací, dnes je odborností oboru Zubního lékařství (ZL) a každý praktický zubní lékař musí teoreticky i\nprakticky ovládat ošetřování dětí na úrovni dalších odborností ZL (konzervační ZL, protetické ZL, orální chirurgie, parodontologie a onemocnění sliznic\ndutiny ústní, základního oboru Ortodoncie,). I v současnosti, kdy se počet studentů v ročnících pohybuje mezi 80 až 90, je nutné připravit studenty po\npraktické i teoretické stránce ke způsobilosti k samostatnému ošetřování dočasného i stálého chrupu dětí lege artis (naplnění zákona 95/2004 Sb). Aby\nstudenti splnili tyto požadavky je nezbytně nutné zajistit všechny požadované typy preparace zubů včetně jejich endodontického ošetřování, zejména v\ndočasném chrupu, nejdříve na speciálních simulátorech. Vysoký počet přímého ošetření dětí a soustředění jejich ošetřování do doby omezené výukou,\nnení ve skutečnosti proveditelné.

Přitom posudková problematika je nesporně významnou součástí léčebně preventivní péče všech klinických oborů. Ošetřující lékaři proto nezbytně potřebují znát posudkové zásady u nejdůležitějších skupin nemocí nebo chorobných stavů. Všeobecný praktický lékař pro dospělé a posudkový lékař se ve své praxi běžně setkává s oblastí tzv. pojistných agend; nemocenské, invalidní důchody. Méně často s oblastí tzv. nepojistných agend, tj. státní sociální podporou, sociální pomocí (mimořádné výhody), sociálními službami (příspěvek na péči), hmotnou nouzí. Je však zřejmé, že všichni ošetřující lékaři potřebují ucelené základní znalosti z teorie lékařské posudkové činnosti. Cílem je koncipovat možnosti a podmínky pregraduálního vzdělávání v oboru posudkové lékařství jako samostatného povinně volitelného nebo volitelného předmětu v rámci magisterského jednooborového studia všeobecného lékařství na Lékařské fakultě Masarykovy univerzity.

Protože epiteliální sodíkový kanál (ENaC) hraje zásadní roli v detekci změn krevního tlaku u člověka, předpokládáme, že  některé z jeho mutací by mohly mít vliv na hodnotu citlivosti baroreflexu (BRS). Dále předpokládáme, že negenetické faktory (hmotnost, tuhost tepen) mohou posunout BRS k nižším hodnotám nezávisle na genetické determinaci. V současnosti nejsou k dispozici výsledky žádné studie zabývající se vztahem mezi mutacemi ENaC a BRS. Fyziologická data budou získána kontinuálním neinvazivním měřením krevního tlaku (BRS, variabilita krevního tlaku), aplanační tonometrií (augmentační index, rychlost pulzové vlny) a ultrazvukovým vyšetřením (tloušťka intimy-médie).

Plánovaný projekt má dva základní cíle zahrnující genomové sekvencování řady vybraných kmenů treponem a sekvenční analýzu transkriptomů několika patogenních kmenů. Bude sekvencováno nejméně 10 kmenů treponem, a to na úroveň vysoce kvalitní kompletní genomové sekvence. Tyto sekvence budou použity pro definici minimálního počtu genetických změn odlišujících zástupce poddruhů pallidum a pertenue. Budou sekvencovány také kmeny izolované z klinického materiálu a kmen způsobující syfilis zajíců, T. paraluisleporis. Sekvenační metody budou použity také pro analýzu transkriptomů nejméně 6 treponemálních kmenů způsobujících syfilis a yaws. Treponemální promotory budou identifikovány pomocí reporterového plasmidu s luxCDABE geny.",

Vzhledem k tomu, že zuby jsou mnohdy lépe zachovány než jiný kosterní materiál, je jejich použití pro odhad věku rozhodující. Současné výzkumy naznačují, že odhad věku podle počtu soustředných vrstev zubního cementu může být přesnější než odhad věku pomocí jiných morfologických a histologických změn také u lidí, a ne jen u jiných druhů savců. Existují však ale i závěry jiné. Jednotlivé vrstvy cementu lidských zubů se hodnotí na zubních výbrusech pomocí různých mikroskopických technik. Vrstvy se většinou jeví jako soustředné světlé a tmavé prstence. Cílem projektu je zhodnotit využití počtu apozičních vrstev cementu na kořeni zubu pro odhad dožitého věku člověka na vzorku zubů současné české populace, výsledky srovnat s hodnocením věku pomocí jiných metod odhadu věku podle zubů a bude-li možné, vypracovat identifikační klíč pro určování věku pomocí hodnocení jednotlivých vrstev cementu pro praktické použití zejména ve forenzní antropologii.",

Navrhovaný projekt navazuje na naše nedávno publikované výsledky, které ukázaly, že lignany deoxyschizandrin a γ-schizandrin byly schopny překonat rezistenci buněk plicního karcinomu vůči cytostatiku doxorubicinu. Projekt předpokládá prozkoumáni účinku lignanů na sérii rezistentních buněčných linii, jejichž rezistence je dána především zvýšenou expresí ABC transportérů. Bude zaměřen na skríning aktivity lignanů ze dvou hledisek 1) antiproliferační aktivity lignanů samotných a na studium synergického účinku lignanů s cytostatiky, 2) schopnosti ovlivnit ABC transportéry. Budou vytipovány účinné lignany a mechanizmus jejich účinku bude studován podrobněji. Aktivitou řízená izolace lignanů z rostlinného materiálu a jejich semisynteticka modifikace, včetně přípravy enantiomerů, umožní získáni aktivnějších derivátů a nalezeni vztahu mezi strukturou a účinkem.",

V patogenezi MM existují dvě dráhy vývoje této choroby: hyperdiploidní (HRD) a nehyperdiploidní (NHRD). NHRD dráha je charakterizována IgH translokacemi v post-germinálních B buňkách.

Neexistují žádně vhodné prognostické markery, které by byly snadno dostupné a které by bylo možno odebírat bez většího nepohodlí pro pacienty. miRNA jsou krátké nekódující RNA, které ovlivňují expresi genů a nedávno byly spojeny s iniciací, prognózou a rozvojem nemocí. miRNA jsou velmi stabilní i v séru a my předpokládáme, že mohou být použity jako prognostické markery pro pacienty s vysokým rizikem relapsu MM. Chceme najít kandidátní panel sérových miRNA pomocí arraye na bázi real-time PCR. Role těchto miRNA bude objasněna v in vitro pokusech, abychom pochopili jejich roli v patogenezi MM a jejich možný účinek na buněčnou proliferaci, apoptózu a buněčný cyklus.",

Realizace předloženého projektu přispěje ke zlepšení kvality života nemocných a zlepšení prognózy onemocnění u zařazených pacientů, což je v souladu s prioritami státního programu vyhlášeného ve veřejné soutěži.  Využití terapeutického potenciálu nízkofrekvenční EMS ve standardních RHB programech na jednotkách intenzívní péče by mohlo být  účinným prostředkem zlepšení zdravotního stavu u pacientů s nutričním deficitem.",

Projevuje se především paresteziemi, hypestézií ruky, parézou a atrofií svalů na ruce a svalů předloktí. Vznik této neuropatie nejčastěji navazuje na chronický útlak v oblasti lokte, opakovaná poranění, na vrozeně mělký sulcus nervus ulnaris, na přetěžování svalově kosterního aparátu. Postupná progrese klinických příznaků má významný dopad na socioekonomické potřeby a kvalitu života pacientů. Invazivní terapie je přínosná pouze u části pacientů a konzervativní postup není jednoznačně standardizován. Hlavním cílem studie je objektivizovat terapeutický efekt elektrostimulace u léze nervus ulnaris v oblasti lokte pomocí klinické elektromyografie, dotazníkových, motorických testů a neurologického vyšetření. Vedlejším cílem je najít  nejsenzitivnější a nejméně časově náročný postup vyšetření léze nervus ulnaris. Na základě výsledků bude vypracováno doporučení pro diagnostiku, sledování a fyzioterapii neuropatie nervus ulnaris.",

   "annotation": "Legionely jsou bakterie všudypřítomné v přírodním i umělém  vodním prostředí. Z různých zdrojů (nejčastěji z nedostatečně udržovaných technických systémů s vodní náplní) se šíří vzdušnou cestou - kontaminovaným aerosolem. U exponovaných osob vdechnutí legionel může vyvolat závažné plicní onemocnění. Trvalé odstranění legionel z vodních systémů je velmi obtížné. Zásadními faktory pro prevenci a kontrolu je průzkum kontaminace vodních systémů a následná provozně technická opatření. \nSmyslem projektu je ve veřejných budovách Masarykovy univerzity, konkrétně v Univerzitním kampusu Bohunice, mikrobiologickým vyšetřením vzorků vody ověřit možnou přítomnost, distribuci a rozmanitost druhů legionel v technických systémech a navrhnout vhodná opatření. V UKB probíhá výuka studentů a jsou zde umístěna i odborná a administrativní pracoviště zaměstnanců Masarykovy univerzity. Jde o rozsáhlý moderní členitý objekt s automatizovaným provozem klimatizace, větrání, vytápění a zásobování vodou, ve kterém se pohybuje v průběhu dne množství osob. Provozní zatížení v průběhu roku  je nerovnoměrné.  V těsné blízkosti UKB je fakultní nemocnice ošetřující množství osob vysoce vnímavých k nákaze. Z těchto důvodů je potřeba znát množství a umístění technických zařízení jako potenciálních zdrojů a hlavně reálnou přítomnost legionel v nich. Podle zjištěných skutečností pak bude možno nastavit adekvátní preventivní opatření (pravidelná údržba,  provozní kontrola, mikrobiologický monitoring, popř. použití trvalé desinfekce biocidy). Tím budou splněny i legislativní požadavky, vycházející zejména ze zákona 258/2000 Sb. o ochraně veřejného zdraví a z vyhl. 293/2006 Sb., o hygienických požadavcích na pitnou a teplou vodu  - usilovat technickými opatřeními o minimalizaci  přítomnosti legionel ve vodě a minimalizaci rizika onemocnění osob.",

Mutace a/nebo delece v genu TP53 se objevují u 10-15% pacientů a jejich přítomnost vede k velmi špatné prognóze, zahrnující téměř vždy nezbytnost terapie a navzdory tomu velmi krátkou dobu přežití.  Delece 11(q) (delece lokusu ATM) je jednou z nejčastějších abnormalit nalézanou v CLL buňkách a je asociována s nepříznivou prognózou a narušenou odpovědí buněk na poškození DNA navozené chemoterapeutiky. Clíle projektu jsou následující:  (a) provést prognostickou stratifikaci pacientů – tedy stanovit čas do terapie, reakci na léčbu a celkové přežití - v závislosti na typu mutace v p53 - tato sudie nebyla dosud u CLL provedena, ačkoli její význam je zřejmý z analýzy jiných malignit (b) ověřit, jaký je význam kompletní inaktivace genu ATM (delece 11q doprovázaná mutací druhé alely) pro celkové přežití CLL pacientů a jejich reakci na léčbu (c) testovat možnost zablokovat opravy DNA ve vysoce rizikových CLL buňkách s defekty v p53 a/nebo ATM pomocí inhibice kinázy Chk1 a tím senzitivizovat tyto buňky na poškození DNA navozené chemoterapeutiky. V projektu očekáváme další zpřesnění prognostické stratifikace CLL pacientů s nejvážnějšími defekty v genech TP53 a ATM ve FN Brno. To umožní jejich směrování pro nejvhodnější možnou léčbu, s efektem jejich potenciálně lepšího přežití a výrazně menších léčebných komplikací (zásadní úspora za nevhodně aplikované léky, které mohou pacienty principiálně dokonce poškodit). Projekt naplňuje vyhlášený cíl \"Podpora molekulárně-biologických přístupů v odpovídajících oblastech zdravotnického výzkumu a vývoje\" a reaguje na vyhlášenou prioritu \"Využít exprese genů a proteinů jako prediktivních a prognostických ukazatelů\".",

Zvláštní důraz pak bude kladen na možnost aktivace p53 v nádorech, v nichž je funkce p53 vyřazena nadměrnou expresí endogenních inhibičních proteinů Mdm2, MdmX nebo virového proteinu E6, jako jsou např. některé sarkomy a karcinomy prsu nebo děložního čípku. Budou proto hledány a testovány i kombinace inhibitorů funkce těchto proteinů s chemickými látkami, které jsou schopny účinně aktivovat p53. Dále budou hledány nové buněčné regulátory p53, které by mohly sloužit jako cíle pro molekulárně cílenou terapii některých typů nádorů. Při řešení projektu budou používány zejména tyto techniky: kultivace buněčných linií, testy cytotoxicity a apoptózy, průtoková cytometrie, fluorescenční mikroskopie, purifikace a proteomická analýza proteinových komplexů, transfekce siRNA a DNA,  SDS-PAGE a imunobloting.",

Prioritou projektuje je modifikace standardu klasifikačního systému ošetřovatelských intervencí NIC pro podmínky ČR, tak, aby mohly sloužit jako podklad ukazatele efektivity, kvality ošetřovatelské péče a zdravotnických služeb. Zavedením modifikované mezinárodně uznávané klasifikace ošetřovatelských intervencí – NIC, budou konkretizovány  kompetence a povinností ošetřovatelského  personálu, možnosti exaktního sledování a vyhodnocování plnění ošetřovatelských činností. Při přesném plnění ošetřovatelských činností dle seznamu NIC bude zajištěna minimální ošetřovatelská péče u každého z klientů (modifikace standardu ošetřovatelské péče). Do budoucna lze doplněnou klasifikace užít za účelem stanovování plateb za ošetřovatelskou péči a k výpočtu personálního obsazení ošetřovacích jednotek.",

Vzdělávací proces se tímto systémem výrazně zefektivňuje a současně se zvyšuje evropská konkurenceschopnost zapojených lékařských fakult. \nV roce 2011 je třeba WikiSkripta rozšířit jako inovativní systém pro elektronickou podporu výuky. Jsou prostorem pro tvorbu a sdílení výukových materiálů. Jejich ostrý provoz byl zahájen na 1. lékařské fakultě UK v roce 2009. I přes krátkou dobu své existence zaznamenávají natolik prudký růst využívání, že nyní vyžadují podstatné posílení technického zázemí a studentské redakční podpory, která autorům technicky a administrativně pomáhá s tvorbou obsahu. Současně roste zájem o Wikiskripta na dalších lékařských fakultách a proto je třeba postupně vyškolit redakční týmy na všech lékařských fakultách, aby byly schopny podporovat lokální autory. K naplnění tohoto cíle bude třeba získat nové členy studentských redakčních týmů a uspořádat pro ně řadu školení a seminářů. Počítáme s dalším vývojem SW-prostředí WikiSkript, aby integrovalo nové směry vývoje. Úpravy technického vybavení posílí možnosti komunikace mezi týmy.",

S využitím nové generace multimediálních učebních pomůcek s vysokým zastoupením interaktivních prvků si budou moci studenti ověřit v praxi schopnosti uvažování lékaře u akutního pacienta. Jedná se především o rozhodovací algoritmy, které jsou popsány v doporučeních odborných lékařských společností. Přidaná hodnota vypracovaných učebních pomůcek v rámci předloženého projektu bude ve způsobu prezentace těchto algoritmů. Student, budoucí lékař, se díky jejich interaktivní formě ujistí ve zvládání akutních situací souvisejících s navrácením základních životních funkcí pacientovi, zafixuje si lépe přesné reakce a nenechá se pak v praxi zmást druhotnými problémy. Dalším momentem, který si projekt klade za cíl postihnout, je zefektivnění výuky akutní medicíny s využitím edukačního webového portálu, kde budou vypracované učební pomůcky umístěny spolu s dalšími typy vzdělávacích materiálů orientovaných na podobná témata. Výrazně se tak studentům usnadní orientace v oboru a všem pedagogům, kteří se podílejí buď přímo na výuce akutní medicíny, nebo vyučují akutní stavy v rámci svých lékařských disciplín, napomůže ke sjednocení výuky zpracovaných témat.",

Na indukci angiogeneze/vaskulogeneze se podílejí angiogenní aktivátory, které stimulují endotelové buňky (EC) nebo rekrutují cirkulující endotelové prekurzory (CEC). Za zdroj CEC jsou považovány CD14+monocyty (CD14+ MO) exprimující angiogenní marker Tie-2. CD14+ MO hrají potenciální roli v novotvorbě cév a tumorigenezi. Mechanismy zodpovědné za transdiferenciaci CD14+ MO do CEC jsou však zatím nejasné. V současnosti je za nejvýznamnější angiogenní marker u MM při použití konvenční terapie považován hepatocytární růstový faktor (HGF). HGF je nalézán ve vysokých koncentracích v plazmě pacientů s MM a jeho signalizace hraje pravděpodobné klíčovou roli v mikroprostředí KD. HGF je pleiotropní faktor se širokým spektrem účinků na různé buněčné populace. Jeho role ve stimulaci angiogeneze a indukci vaskulogeneze však nebyla v patofyziologii MM podrobněji studována.",

Jejím cílem je odstranění epileptického ložiska a úplné vyléčení pacienta. Kruciální je však přesná identifikace epileptogenní zóny. K tomuto účelu se využívá kombinace\nrůzných zobrazovacích metod (skalpové/intrakraniální EEG, SISCOM, PET). Simultánní EEG-fMRI je poměrně novou metodou kombinující vynikající vlastnosti obou metod a umožňující identifikovat oblasti s hemodynamickými změnami přímo souvisejícími s interiktálními epileptickými výboji. V případě jednoduché a nejčastěji používané analýzy fMRI signálu časově spřaženého s výskytem interiktálních epileptických výbojů v EEG záznamu jsou spolehlivé výsledky dosahovány jenom asi u třetiny pacientů. Nové postupy zpracování dat (ICA, CCA) mohou velmi pravděpodobně významně zlepšit vypovídací schopnost této metody a zvýšit validitu výsledků u kandidátů epileptochirurgického zákroku.",

Nejhorším relapsem je extramedulárni relaps (EM), pacienti přežívají jen několik měsíců od diagnózy. MiRNA jsou krátké nekódující dsRNA, které ovlivňují expresi genů a nedávno byly spojeny s iniciací, prognózou a vývojem nemocí. MicroRNA jsou velmi stabilní i v séru a naše hypotéza zní, že mohou být použity jako prognostické markery pro pacienty s vysokým rizikem relapsu MM. Chceme najít kandidátní panel sérových miRNA na platformě real-time PCR. Dále, role těchto miRNA bude objasněna v in vitro pokusech, abychom pochopili jejich roli v patogenezi MM a jejích možný účinek na buněčnou proliferaci, apoptózu a buněčný cyklus.",

Cíle projektu jsou zaměřeny na ošetřovatelskou, sociální, RHB a reedukační péči. Jedinečnost projektu tkví  v zaměření na dvě populace: profesionální pečující na Klinice interní, geriatrie a praktického lékařství  a laické pečovatele (blízké hospitalizovaných seniorů). Cílem  projektu  je zlepšení sociokulturních a odborných kompetencí pečujících a  zlepšení kompetencí profesionálních pečovatelů (v sociální interakci se seniory, schopnosti efektivních komunikačních technik, identifikaci ageismu, užití objektivizovatelných testů  hodnocení seniorů). U laických pečujících je vzdělávání orientováno na informovanost v uspokojování potřeb seniorů. K dosažení cílů bude provedeno vstupní a výstupní dotazníkové šetření k hodnocení znalostí pečujících, na něž naváží vzdělávací semináře, e-learningový kurz a online poradna.",

Očekáváme, že se podaří určit příčinu zvýšené incidence MM. Naší hypotézou je, že pacienti s extramedulárním relapsem mají v organismu přítomen odlišný klon nádorových buněk, který je schopen tvořit ložiska mimo skelet. Předpokládáme existenci dvou typů plasmocytů a to v dřeňovém a měkkotkáňovém kompartmentu. Určení tohoto klonu tak může vést k optimalizaci léčebných algoritmů a přispět k výrazně lepší prognóze nemocných s MM.",

To je jeden z globálních cílů projektu, umět vybrat vhodnou léčbu pro konkrétního člověka trpícího maligní nemocí.Vzhledem k tomu, že současné medikamentózní léčebné postupy přesahují v některých případech jeden milión korun na indukční léčbu, je jistě žádoucí najít faktory, dle nichž bude možné zjistit, zda daná léčba bude mít či nebude mít konkrétní přínos.\n\nIntenzivní léčba však sebou přináší také mnoho komplikací. Nejčastěji jsou to infekční komplikace. Příčinu je mnohdy velmi obtížné diagnostikovat a bez zjištění příčiny není cílené léčby. Proto součástí programu je také optimalizace diagnostiky a léčby komplikací, souvisejících s léčbou maligních chorob.",

Projekt je veden snahou o nalezení bezpečné léčebné strategie v léčbě zejména autoimunitních onemocnění, která v současné době představují obrovské riziko v civilizovaných zemích včetně České republiky. S využitím různých kultivačních přístupů a imunologických technik bude v předkládaném projektu optimalizována příprava MSC tak, aby splnila veškerá kritéria bezpečnosti, kvality a jakosti pro budoucí klinické použití jako imunomodulační a biologická léčba vybraných autoimunitních onemocnění. Rovněž bude provedena analýza microRNA MSC ve vztahu k autoimunitním onemocněním a k hematopoeze. Konečným cílem projektu je pak návrh klinického léčebného protokolu. Řešení projektu bude probíhat v Univerzitním centru buněčné imunoterapie Masarykovy univerzity, které jako jediné v ČR je držitelem povolení SÚKL k přípravě individualizovaných protinádorových vakcín na akademické půdě.",

Mdm2 funguje\njako ubikvitin ligáza pro p53 a indukuje degradaci p53 v proteasomu 26S. Příbuzný protein MdmX, jenž nemá\nubikvitin ligázovou aktivitu a nedokáže indukovat degradaci p53, účinně inhibuje transkripční aktivitu proteinu\np53. V předchozí studii se nám však podařilo prokázat, že i MdmX se může aktivně podílet na degradaci p53\njako součást komplexu s Mdm2, jeho přesná úloha při ubikvitylaci p53 však stále zůstává nejasná. Proto\nhodláme pomocí cílené mutageneze provést srovnání a funkční analýzu RING domén Mdm2 a MdmX, které\numožňují vzájemnou vazbu těchto proteinů a jsou též nezbytné pro ubikvitin ligázovou aktivitu jejich\nkomplexu.

   "annotation": "Epilepsie je nejčastější ze všech závažných neurologických onemocnění. Přibližně u jedné třetiny pacientů je farmakologická léčba neśpěšná a záchvaty přetrvávají. V těchto případech se někdy přistupuje k operační léčbě. Jejím ideálním cílem je odstranění epileptického ložiska a úplné vyléčení nemocného jedince. V rámci přípravy epileptochirurgického řešení je zcela zásadní přesná identifikace epileptického ložiska, či přesněji epileptogenní zóny. V současnosti však neexistuje metoda, která by samostatně dokázala tento cíl splnit . Velmi nadějným se v dané souvislosti zdálo být simultánní snímání EEG a funkční MRI (EEG-fMRI). Jedná se o multimodální zobrazovací techniku, kde jsou EEG a fMRI data snímána současně. Tato metoda v zásadě umožňuje zobrazit na MR snímcích mozku oblasti s hemodynamickými změnami přímo souvisejícími s interiktálními epileptickými výboji. V případě jednoduché analýzy MR signálu časově spřaženého s výskytem interiktálního epileptického výboje v EEG záznamu, však tato poskytuje spolehlivé výsledky pouze cca u třetiny pacientů s ložiskovou epilepsií. Nové postupy zpracování MR signálu (zejména analýza nezávislých komponent /ICA/ a jiné vícerozměrné metody) mohou velmi pravděpodobně významně zlepšit vypovídací schopnost EEG-fMRI a zvýšit validitu výsledků u kandidátů epileptochirurgického zákroku. Cílem předkládaného projektu je optimalizovat metodiku analýzy EEG-fMRI dat  s využitím \"data-driven\" postupů (zejména ICA EEG a MR dat či kanonické korelační analýzy).",

Zpracovány budou výsledky zobrazovacích metod, fotodokumentace, názorné videosekvence a fotosérie chirurgických postupů při léčbě zmíněných patologických stavů. Cílem je výše zmíněnou problematiku zpracovat multimediální formou, která by byla co nejpřehlednější, nejsrozumitelnější a snadno dostupná. Cílovou skupinou jsou především studenti stomatologie a zubního lékařství a jejich vyučující, ale přínosem bude i studentům dalších oborů lékařských fakult.",

V současné době již čtvrtý rok přijímáme do 1. ročníku 80až90 studentů. Zvýšené nároky na praktickou výuku zajišťujeme v souladu s mezinárodním trendem edukace rozšířením praktické simulované výuky v předmětech Zubního lékařství do všech ročníků studia. Simulovanou výuku na speciálně upravených simulátorech využíváme v předmětu Preklinické zubní lékařství, v rámci jednotlivých odborností, částečně pak i v předmětech Gnatologie, Protetické zubní lékařství, Konzervační zubní lékařství v jednotlivých oddílech, Dětské zubní lékařství, Parodontologie, Orální chirurgie v celém průběhu výuky podzimního a jarního semestru všech ročníků a částečně i při prázdninové praxi.

Schopnost proliferace bez limitu a udržení pluripotentního stavu jsou úzce spjaty s regulací buněčného cyklu. Nedávné publikace ukazují na fakt, že řízení buněčného cyklu v hES buňkách je odlišné od regulace buněčného cyklu v somatických buňkách. Regulace buněčného cyklu u hES buněk je dosud velmi málo prostudována a není známo, jak buněčný cyklus ovlivňuje vlastnosti hES buněk.\n\nV somatických buňkách je buněčný cyklus řízen postupnou aktivací cyklin dependentních kináz (CDK) v závislosti na průchodu jednotlivými fázemi buněčného cyklu.

   "annotation": "Hlavním cílem tohoto projektu je vývoj miniaturizovaného systému pro \"on-line\" studie metabolismu léčiv založeného na kapilární elektroforéze, který bude orientovaný na nejdůležitější skupinu detoxikačních enzymů I. fáze metabolismu léčiv - cytochromy P450. Díky tomu by měl být k dispozici systém umožňující analýzu velkého množství vzorků, což rovněž omezí množství in vivo experimentů na laboratorních zvířatech. Hlavní pozornost přitom bude zaměřena na metodu elektroforeticky zprostředkované mikroanalýzy EMMA (Electrophoretically Mediated MicroAnalysis), neboť ji lze plně automatizovat, a na konstrukci enzymového reaktoru s imobilizovanými isoformami cytochromu P450, který by měl být rovněž \"on-line\" spojen se separací pomocí kapilární elektroforézy. Klasické \"pre-capillary\" stanovení bude použito pouze jako podpůrná metoda. Speciální pozornost bude věnována kombinaci kapilární elektroforézy s detekcí pomocí MS. Uvedená metoda bude použita ke studiu různých isoforem cytochromů P450 za použití různých módů kapilární elektroforézy. Jako komplementární metoda bude použita HPLC s různými detekčními technikami - UV-VIS, FLU, EC a MS.",

MM patří  v současné době k nevyléčitelným onemocněním. MM tvoří 1 % všech nádorových onemocnění a přes 10 % všech krevních nádorových onemocnění.  Významnou roli ve vývoji a progresi MM hraje angiogeneze. Klíčovým faktorem v indukci neovaskularizace je hepatocytární růstový faktor (HGF). Za nejdůležitější inhibitor angiogeneze je považován trombospondin-1(TP1). V patogenezi MM se významně uplatňují specifické chromozomální abnormality. Potenciální význam v regulaci angiogeneze má především delece genu TP53 a RB1 a zisk 1q21. Cílem práce je vyhodnocení prediktivního a prognostického významu vybraných faktorů u MM z oblasti genomiky a angiogeneze, nalezení korelací mezi těmito faktory a stanovení jejich kombinované prognostické síly v multivariační analýze.",

Mezi kandidátní geny tohoto onemocnění patří gen pro kolagen IX, který se kromě jiných tkání vyskytuje právě v meziobratlových ploténkách. Do studie bude zařazeno celkem 200 osob, z toho 100 kontrolních osob a 100 osob s diagnózou výhřezu meziobratlové ploténky. DNA analýza bude prováděna ze vzorků krve. V rámci studie bude analyzován polymorfizmus genu pro kolagen IX. Studie tohoto typu jsou v současné době prováděny po celém světě s ohledem na možnost predikce předčasné degenerace popřípadě výhřezu meziobratlové ploténky. Tímto by bylo možno zachovat jedince dlouho v produktivním věku, což přináší i ekonomické benefity (snížení výdajů na operaci, léčbu atd.).",

Experimentálním záměrem je zjistit vliv podání agonisty kanabinoidních CB1 a CB2 receptorů (O-2545 hydrochlorid; Tocris) na metabolickou aktivitu jaterních isoforem cytochromu P450 (CYP). Polské pracoviště již dříve publikovalo prokázaný vliv dopaminergní neurotransmise v CNS na metabolickou aktivitu jaterních isoforem CYP. Naše pracoviště se zabývá výzkumem v oblasti endokanabinoidního systému, o němž je známo, že má vliv na dopaminergní aktivitu v mozku. Kanabinoidní receptory chceme stimulovat opakovaným podáním látky O-2545 do \npotkaní mozkové struktury Ncl. accumbens u níž je prokázána interkomunikace mezi dopaminergním a kanabinoidním systémem. Část experimentů in vivo bude uskutečněna na brněnském pracovišti a ex vivo budou odebrány tkáňové vzorky z jater. Polské pracoviště stanoví metabolické aktivity in vitro po izolaci mikrosomální frakce. Naměřené koncentrace modelové látky a jejích metabolitů pak budou statisticky porovnány mezi skupinou léčenou O-2525 a kontrolní skupinou. Významem projektu je: a) získání farmakokinetických údajů, jež by mohly být klinicky významné pro bezpečnější farmakoterapii léčivy ordinovanými pro jejich působení v CNS, avšak s možným vlivem na změny terapeutických hladin současně podávaných léčiv\nb) rozšíření užívaného spektra výzkumných metod na obou zúčastněných pracovištích",

V současnosti je známo, že  neurostimulační metody vedou k významné redukci záchvatů cca u 50% implantovaných pacientů. Dosud však nejsme schopni pacienty, kteří profitují z implantace neurostimulátoru, identifikovat na základě jejich předimplantačních dat. Našemu kolektivu se podařilo vyvinout statistický model, který predikuje efekt vagové stimulace na základě rutinního EEG, které bylo natočeno před implantací. Tento statistický model predikuje efekt vagové stimulace s vysokou sensitivitou a specificitou. Nynější projekt vychází z tohoto statistického modelu, snahou je vytvořit obdobný model pro děti s implantovaný vagovým stimulátorem a pro pacienty s hlubokou mozkovou stimulací. Současně si rovněž uvědomujeme nutnost otestovat statistický model na externích datech, toto testování vnímáme jako zásadní pro jeho klinické využití.
