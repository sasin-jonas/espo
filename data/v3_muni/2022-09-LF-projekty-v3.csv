 The project chooses several major medical topics - diseases for which breakthrough scientific knowledge can be expected to be obtained by using current technologies combining the most advanced 3D models (organoids, engineered tissues), genetic analyses, bioactive molecules and ex vivo functional analyses, which are the unifying element of the project.
 The project builds on close collaboration between clinical and theoretical disciplines, paving the way for new preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, and thus has strong application potential.
 The project makes significant use of multidisciplinary approaches, and its design maximises the sharing of knowledge and infrastructure.
 Organisationally, the project is conceived as a close cooperation between theoretical departments of the Faculty of Medicine and the clinical departments of the partner hospitals. It is then joined by interactions with other MU faculties, the Faculty of Pharmacy, the Faculty of Science, CEITEC and the Faculty of Social Studies, as well as with institutions outside MU, the Brno University of Technology (CEITEC), the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the CAS, the Institute of Physiology of the CAS and the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry of the CAS.";EN;;academic, employee

By creating artificial electronic connections to nervous tissue, neural activity can be sensed and also externally modified by electrical stimulation. Smart biomedical devices, built on the interconnection of electronics with living systems, represent one of the fastest growing and promising new directions in medicine today. Such devices can be used to diagnose and treat neurological diseases and injuries. This dynamic field is known as bioelectronic medicine. In parallel, the last decades have been characterized by major advances in nano- and micro-technologies for electronics and optoelectronics. Unfortunately, it is currently difficult to translate state-of-the-art electronic solutions into practice, especially in the European medical community. This gap is largely the result of limited communication and collaboration between electronic technology experts, biomedical engineers and physicians. NeuroBMI's goal is to bridge this gap and create a solid base for manufacturing and testing bioelectronic devices in the Czech Republic. Much of the necessary infrastructure and expertise is already in place, but interdisciplinary links need to be established and deepened with clear intentions. FP1 is dedicated to the development of new neural interface devices for the consortium as a whole and for the wider neuroscience community. FP1 contains four research objectives, A-D: A: Implantable brain probes to advance neuroscience research in animals; B: Implantable neural interfaces for peripheral nerves in animal models; C: New integrated magnetoelectronic devices for wireless power transfer; D: Accelerated component lifetime testing and systematic investigation of functional failures.";EN;;academic, employee

It aims at identifying the origin of epileptic seizures within the brain to target surgery and cure the epilepsy. Due to its unmatched temporal resolution (in the order of the millisecond) and spatial precision (millimetric), iEEG offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms leading to the emergence of seizure, develop novel biomarkers to improve the outcome of epilepsy surgery (e.g. high-frequency oscillations (HFOs)) but also investigate brain physiology. Indeed, many of the 150 to 250 recording leads available in each investigated patients are located in normal brain tissue, and thus enable to study normal brain function, including cognition. The main limitation of this research field is the limited number of patients undergoing such investigation, about 500 per year in Europe. This makes iEEG data particularly well suited to data sharing, data re-use and data FAIRification. With this view in mind, the European Flagship Human Brain Project has developed a platform dedicated to this objective, the Human Intracerebral EEG platform (HIP). This cloud-based, GDPR-compliant open-source platform precisely aims at sharing and re-using iEEG data, software and research projects at an international scale. Two of the partners (CHUV and HCL) were involved in this development, with CHUV being its product owner. The first beta release of the HIP was performed last September, and the platform will be available to develop use-cases from February 2023.;EN;;academic, employee

The goal of this project is to build a strong and internationally recognized center of chemical biology research that will pursue interdisciplinary studies utilizing synergistic interactions of several disciplines, especially biology and chemistry, and will explore practical applications of the research outcomes. 
Understanding the chemico-biological interactions at different levels is essential for both intervention and treatment (e.g. development of new small molecules as pharmacologically active substances/drugs to treat disease conditions) as well as for prevention of adverse outcomes and understanding of the effects of pollutants in the environment. Typically, these two aspects are currently studied separately. This project will improve sharing of personnel, research infrastructures and capacities in these two areas and will thereby bring major added value for chemical biology science and fulfil the planned objectives. 
The main strategic goal of this project is to build a top-quality research hub in the field of chemical biology that will generate globally competitive know-how with attractive commercial potential and significant societal impact. The project will exploit the long-term investment of MUNI into this research area – specifically building of University Campus Bohunice (UKB), followed by setting up the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and European Centre of excellence in Environmental Health sciences (RECETOX), implementation of numerous large research infrastructures into UKB environment, and more recently by the planned launch of the BioPharmaHub and integration of the Faculty of Pharmacy to MUNI.
This goal will be achieved by intensifying of multidisciplinary interaction among the relevant workplaces (mostly located within one campus), using the potential of the most competitive research teams at MUNI.

The task of physicians is to recognise the typical patterns of diagnoses in this jumble of information (""pattern recognition/inductive reasoning"") or, if no pattern is recognised, to deduce other possible diagnoses from them (""deductive reasoning""). The establishment of a correct diagnosis is an essential step in the initiation of correct and effective treatment, and therefore the process of differential diagnosis and its perfect mastery is a fundamental skill for every physician. In case of uncertainty, or in the presence of general symptoms occurring in several different diseases, various (bio)markers can help in the differential diagnostic analysis, which should reduce the risk of a possible diagnostic error. Similarly, answering the frequent question of our patients ""What's next for me?"", i.e. to provide the patient with information about the future course of his/her disease, is often difficult, and it is the identification of new (bio)markers that may enable this prognostic stratification.

On the other hand, changes in these structures are known to be related to development of serious diseases, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cortical dysplasia in epilepsy and even COVID-19. Early detection of abnormalities in cerebral cortex morphology are a promising approach leading to better diagnostics and treatment. 
We propose an interdisciplinary cooperation between researchers in MR imaging, signal processing and analysis, data science and modelling, machine learning, and neurobiology of mental disorders to deliver a method for imaging and measuring of brain cortical subcomponents. This novel neuroimaging method will be based on tailored T1 relaxometry, component modelling, classification with machine learning algorithms, and signal transformations. The ability of the proposed method to capture the targeted fine gray matter structures will be evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art results as well.  
Using this multidisciplinary approach, we aim at increasing the spatial resolution of brain structural magnetic resonance imaging which at its current state does not enable to directly detect and evaluate relevant neuropathological features. Our proposed neuroimaging method will enable visualization and measurement of the cortical subcomponents that correspond to individual cortical layers. 
The enhancement in the resolution will enable interpretation of the disease processes, treatment effects and their mutual interactions in vivo, and deliver missing information for better diagnostics and treatment regimens in psychiatry.

The result is thereafter a maintaining of good quality of patient’s life, which has direct economic consequences for patient’s family and for public finances, because health and social care costs do not increase. In the past years the works have been published, in which artificial intelligence had been used to analyse finding on MRI of brain. Our goal is to examine, whether the artificial intelligence can be used in direct diagnosis.

The source is usually the patient, rarely a reservoir in the environment. Its production occurs mainly during certain therapeutic or diagnostic procedures. Bioaerosol may be involved in the transmission of agents such as SARS-CoV-2 or MDR bacterial strains. Risk minimisation can be achieved through organisational, barrier and technical measures. However, assessing and comparing the effectiveness of these practices in practice is very difficult and often their implementation is based on purely empirical experience.

Also, cells undergoing the process of cell death release EVs into their surroundings, which not only affect surrounding and relatively distant cells with different effects but also carry specific information about the type of cell death that is taking place in the dying cells.

Nowadays, cytostatic drugs are commonly used in the treatment of cancer, which unfortunately only affect the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant cells. New anti-cancer therapeutic approaches aimed specifically against invasiveness and metastasis are still lacking. Migrastatic strategies represent a unique therapeutic approach preventing the development of systemic malignant disease and limiting cancer-related death. As the migration machinery has been shown to promote metastatic dissemination, a successful migrastatic therapy may reduce the need for high-dose cytotoxic therapies currently used to prevent the risk of metastatic dissemination, which can be beneficial to a patient's well-being. The best targets for migrastatic therapy would be those that are required by all forms of motility, such as ATP availability, mitochondrial metabolism, and cytoskeleton rearrangement.Pentamethinium salts (PMS) are a group of compounds characterized by fluorescence and variable cytotoxicity depending on the structure of the molecule and can play an important role in influencing the migration potential of tumor cells. PMS exhibit exceptional affinity and selectivity for cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane and have excellent photostability, fluorescence properties and low phototoxicity.

The assessment of the treatment response in the chick ChorioAllantoic Membrane (CAM) model can represent a useful screening tool for personalized medicine with the potential to improve patient management and treatment outcome. Destruction of the basement membrane can be easily visualized and tumour growth, invasion into the connective tissue, and metastasis can be accurately quantified in CAM assay, making CAM a valuable model for investigating cancer progression.

These prenatal exposures have long-lasting consequences for the child, manifesting as emotional and behavioral problems. Still, the mechanisms of this intergenerational transmission are not well understood. The ambition of MaHeChiDe is to identify the mechanisms underlying the relationships between maternal health during pregnancy and brain and behavior in the child. We aim to test the mediatory role of inflammation and accelerated aging in these relationships and demonstrate what environmental factors might magnify or protect against the negative impact of maternal illness during pregnancy. Preliminary work from my group demonstrated long-lasting impact of maternal depression during pregnancy on aging of the brain in young adulthood but the knowledge of the mechanisms has been limited by the lack of human longitudinal data with rich biosamples, neuroimaging, and decent sample size. Moreover, detailed assessments in early life, when the processes emerge, might be critical. We hypothesize that maternal mental health problems will be associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers and higher epigenetic age in the pregnant mother. We also hypothesize that higher levels of these markers will be in turn associated with lower epigenetic gestational age in the newborn and altered biological aging, neurodevelopment, and cognitive skills in childhood. If succeeded, this high risk – high gain project would provide ground-breaking new insights into the mechanisms of developmental programming and allow development of targeted interventions that would reduce the odds of mental illness in the new generations.;EN;;Employee

Episodic healthcare practices are ‘hospital-centric’ and are a norm since decades. Even though such system works successfully for routine ailments such as common cold, sore throat, and flu, but it is not suitable for chronic diseases and/or behavioral issues such as diabetes, depression, substance abuse, and cancer. Such conditions need multiple visits to doctors, constant treatments, and screening from time to time. All of this leads to a burden not only on patients and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system as a whole. All this points towards the need of continuous healthcare monitoring to either predict healthcare issues or diagnose them at very early stage, before they turn into chronic issues. Consequently, the world is moving towards ‘patient-centric’ continuum healthcare system focused on routine physical check-ups. Unfortunately, despite an alarming rise in the cases of mental issues, such systems are not yet well established for routine mental health check-ups.

Subpleural nodules in the lung parenchyma are usually not visible intraoperatively and their detection is possible only with the help of gentle palpation by the surgeon. However, this is often associated with the need to perform an open thoracotomy. Moreover, some small nodules, especially non-solid and sub-solid nodules, have similar rigidity to normal parenchyma and therefore are not palpable. Several techniques were developed, including patent blue V dye application under CT control. Patent blue V can rapidly diffuse into the marked tissues, which are then visually identified by the surgeon. Several studies using patent blue V to localize and facilitate nodule resection were performed. However, all were retrospective and to our best knowledge, no prospective study was done so far. We hypothesize that using patent blue V to guide lung node resection before VATS wedge resection is a safe technique to lower the rate of conversions to thoracotomy, postoperative complications, and mortality. Accordingly, this study will aim to compare intra and postoperative complications, hospital and ICU LOS, quality of life, and 30 days mortality in patients undergoing lung node resection using patent blue V and without.;EN;;academic, employee

In this project, we aim to address unresolved issues in the p53 field and transfer this knowledge to other diagnoses where TP53 defects also play a role. 1) To collect data on TP53 gene variants detected during diagnostics performed at the University Hospital Brno and in collaborating foreign laboratories and to identify variants with unclear clinical significance. 2) To clarify the biological basis and clinical impact of monoallelic TP53 defects by gene expression analysis. 3) To analyse the genetic background of TP53 defects in CLL and to describe whether they are mutually exclusive or associated with certain gene or genomic aberrations. The results of the project will be directly applicable in clinical practice as they will lead to improved diagnosis and prognosis of CLL patients. The findings will also contribute to a general deeper understanding of p53 function in tumours.;EN;;academic, employee

We show that DSBs are formed throughout the first half of prophase I and that unlike DSBs destined to be non-COs, DSBs distended to be COs are generated in a small time-window. This indicates that, contrary to the common view, meiotic DSBs are divided into specific populations that may be targeted differently to DSBR vs. SDSA. Moreover, we show that shifts in the mode of resection are correlated with the transition between these pathways. We propose to leverage the advantages of the genetically tractable model system, C. elegans, to elucidate the mechanisms involved in temporal regulation of DSB formation and processing in meiosis.;EN;;academic, employee

However, by using standard in vitro techniques of cell aggregation, discontinuous media exchange and slow diffusion of nutrients, the population of organoids is highly heterogeneous and their size is limited to small structures. Moreover, in the case of lung organoids, it is difficult to reproduce the cell spectrum and branching complexity of lung tissue without the presence of mesenchyme and capillaries. Thus, it is clear that morphogenesis of larger segments must be supported by the creation of an appropriate microenvironment, including flow, concentration gradient of signaling molecules, and the presence of endothelial and stromal cells.

However, the function of most of these cryptic splice sites, or even entire hidden exons, has not yet been revealed. Thus, these sites (exons) are probably not efficiently used for splicing but may still be recognized and/or subject to splicing that is not efficiently completed, thus contributing to an overall reduction in gene expression. We hypothesize that the specific interaction between these and the surrounding exons and spliceosome is not efficient enough and leads to non-catalytic inhibition of splicing at these sites. Investigation of the regulatory role of these elements is important to fully understand the process of pre-mRNA formation and subsequent expression of such encoded proteins.;EN;;Academic

Two types of C. sativa extracts, rich in CBD and in cannabigerol (CBG), are used as PCB sources in commercial preparations. We found a different effect of CBG and CBD on Nrf2 translocation in vitro and also on liver status after oral use. Home-made remedies can also contain psychotropic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Its effect on Nrf2 is unknown. As PCBs after oral use were found in skin, the project will study risk of long-term topical and oral application of C. sativa extracts, rich in CBD and in CBG and containing also THC with the focus on the Nrf2-driven pathway and barrier function of healthy skin.;EN;;Academic

SCZ requires lifelong treatment with antipsychotic drugs (APDs), but the most effective ones also cause adverse metabolic effects that contribute to cardiovascular risk and cause structural and functional changes in the brain. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been introduced as antidiabetic agents, are newly indicated in the treatment of obesity, and apparently suppress the adverse effects of APDs. Clinical trials are almost impossible to perform in these patients and GLP-1 RAs are therefore not recommended as standard therapy in this indication, mainly due to the lack of data confirming efficacy. In addition, GLP-1 RAs increase neurogenesis, modulate synaptic plasticity and have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. A thorough understanding of the potential of GLP-1 RAs to dually suppress brain changes and concomitant adverse metabolic effects of APDs is crucial for their clinical application, and our optimized preclinical model provides mechanistic insight into this issue.;EN;;Employee

Deviations in metabolism are therefore one of the key features of tumors and a potential therapeutic target. In prostate cancer, compared to most other tumors, oxidative phosphorylation is still the dominant source of ATP production. Maintaining functional mitochondria is therefore crucial. Prostate cancer cells are also specific in terms of biomechanics; an increase in cellular stiffness compared to non-tumor tissue is typical. Although the properties of the plasma membrane with its associated cytoskeleton and the nucleus are mainly involved in cellular stiffness, intracellular organelles may also contribute to the increase in cellular stiffness. Based on our data, a high degree of cross-linking of the mitochondrial network is evident. In light of the abundance of mitochondria and their high fusion and cytoskeletal cross-linking rates, it would be surprising if these organelles, or changes in their cytoskeletal cross-linking rates, were not involved in the increase in cell stiffness. Although this is advantageous in terms of ATP production, it may be a factor limiting migration and invasiveness for cancer cells. The project is based on the hypothesis that the interaction of the mitochondrial network with the cytoskeleton significantly affects cellular rigidity. The aim of the project is to explain the link between mitochondrial architecture, cellular stiffness, cancer cell aggressiveness and metabolism by targeted manipulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission";EN;;employee, academic

In this project, we propose a new view of stemness, based on a system of a constantly fluctuating population of cells with stem-like properties, to explain the constant readiness of tissues to variable environmental influences. The principle of unstable and less predictable stem cell behavior elucidates the efficient maintenance of tissue homeostasis and explains the inherent heterogeneity of stem cells and stemness itself. Using a unique model of the continuously growing mouse incisor combined with modern genetic, transcriptomic and imaging methods, we will test our hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, in vivo.

One of the key roles affecting the prognosis of patients is early and accurate diagnosis. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of gliomas, it is not uncommon to underestimate the specific disease and, as a consequence, to indicate inadequate therapy. However, despite all efforts, conventional diagnostic approaches still fail to detect microscopically more biologically aggressive foci that require a more intensive therapeutic approach. As even the actual treatment of gliomas has not advanced significantly over the last decade compared to other cancers, there is an increasing pressure from physicians to study new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets that would both refine glioma diagnosis and prolong patient survival. Non-coding RNAs, including both microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs, including circular RNAs (circRNAs), appear to be promising molecules in this regard. The key role of miRNAs in cancer pathology, including gliomas, has already been described in detail and generally accepted. In contrast, circRNAs represent a previously understudied group of long non-coding RNAs that arise from pre-mRNAs during reverse splicing, where the 3' end of a transcript is covalently linked to its 5' end to form a stable continuous loop. Their only confirmed function to date is miRNA ""sponging"", i.e. the ability to reversibly bind one or more miRNAs using specific binding sites, which subsequently prevents the miRNA from binding to its molecular targets and thus repressing translation. Moreover, recent data suggest that the levels of some circRNAs are significantly deregulated in gliomas. Therefore, the comprehensive study of circRNAs in gliomas represents a very promising approach to unveil new diagnostic biomarkers and, at the same time, therapeutic tools leading to more effective management of glioma patients.";EN;;Academic

We will focus in detail on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a model disease. CLL is usually characterized by monoclonal expansion of B lymphocytes. Antigenic stimuli are thought to play a key role in its development. However, in our previous work, we described cases of multi-clonal CLL, in which multiple B lymphocytes were clonally expanded in a single patient. These cases can be considered as an intermediate stage between the premalignant stage of monoclonal B lymphocytosis, which despite its name may be multi-clonal, and full-blown CLL. Based on a detailed analysis of the B cell receptor properties of the coexisting clones, we hypothesized that their final malignant transformation occurs at certain levels of B cell maturation. In the proposed project, we will use single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology and chromatin activity determination to identify the molecular profiles of the B cell matriculation stages at which malignant transformation occurs. Furthermore, the literature demonstrates that the initial changes occur at the stem cell level. We hypothesize that in this case, coexisting clones would share at least a few common mutations that would give the clones a selection advantage.

In this context innovation is seen as a means to transform the sector. However, healthcare innovations often fail or don't achieve wider uptake - even when benefits are documented. One of the main reasons is, that in healthcare technological innovation often also requires organisational innovation and the complex systems of multiple agents, their preferences, competences and conflicting interests slows adoption. Thus, the OPUS project reverses this logic by co-creating future care-settings for chronic patients from an organisational perspective as a basis for technological innovation processes. By focusing on life-style and self-management dimensions of chronic diabetes (Brno), coeliac disease (Maribor), hypertension (Rijeka) and frailty (Torino), we aim at transforming the way public healthcare services are provided through a patient-centred lens. These jointly envisioned future care-settings serve as a basis for Open Innovation strategies that through, an improved cross-sector cooperation, enhance the innovation capacities and the uptake of patient-centred approaches and technologies for better and more efficient services for chronic diseases. By deploying a Societal Robustness Methodology for jointly developing four care settings, co-creating four Open Innovation pilots, and anchoring the generalised, cross-regional learnings on the cross-sectoral interface between healthcare and innovation policy, OPUS contributes to improve the life of chronic patients, increases the efficiency of healthcare systems and enhances the cooperation among innovation stakeholders. In this process, cooperation is central for developing a robust understanding of future patient-centred care settings and for identifying challenges for their implementation that arise from different spatial, institutional and cultural contexts.;EN;;Academic

An iPSC-based model of neurodifferentiation will allow us to address the role of senescence in the development and aging of healthy human neurons, as well as to track this cellular response in the pathobiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). We believe that this study will not only introduce innovative approaches for AD/PD research, but will also help to unravel the role of senescence in the biology of healthy nervous systems and during neurodegeneration.;EN;;Academic

It is in line with the latest trends in contemporary oncology, i.e. personalized treatment or ""precision oncology"". Personalized treatment procedures are based on a detailed examination of the specific disease, its evolution over time (repeated biopsies - clonal evolution), biological analysis and the genetic background of the patient. For this purpose, both commercially available and ""in-house"" academic procedures based on molecular biology technologies are used. Data are subjected to bioinformatic analysis, which forms an integral part of these so-called theranostic approaches. Biological material is analysed by next-generation whole exome/genome sequencing (NGS), transcriptional profiling (RNAseq), detection of receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and detection of specific translocations/gene fusions. The panel of assays has been expanded to include methylome sequencing, liquid biopsies and, in 2020, MLPA and low-coverage whole-exome sequencing, among others. The information gathered is evaluated in regular expert meetings - the so-called expert panel (""molecular oncology tumor board""), based on which specific treatment recommendations are made in order to improve treatment outcomes for patients with high-risk cancer, such as children with refractory and relapsed solid tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). This can be achieved by personalized theranostic approaches, as demonstrated by our published results. Based on our experience, the personalized treatment principle can be applied to more than 60% of the patients examined. Our current procedures follow the latest trends in oncology (procedures such as ""liquid dynamic medicine"" and ""N-of-1 clinical trials"").";EN;;Academic

It is essential for neuroplasticity, cognitive development and consolidation of memory traces necessary in the learning process. It is suggested that SWA during deep sleep stages may be an electrophysiological marker of cortical maturation, which is atypical in children with PAS due to differences in thalamocortical circuits.;EN;;Academic

Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field in which this knowledge is used to combine stem/progenitor cells with bioactive materials and flow systems. However, the effective use of any stem cell type is completely dependent on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence stem cell behavior, our ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into functional somatic cell types, or our ability to generate and influence the three-dimensional arrangement of stem and progenitor cells. The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, (i) the molecular mechanisms responsible for genetic instability and genetic modifications of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, (ii) methods for isolation and characterization of the extracellular matrix and their impact on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, and (iii) microfluidic systems will be developed to coculture multiple types of stem and progenitor cells, (iv) the involvement of miRNA molecules in controlling differentiation and establishing stem cell plasticity will be investigated, (v) methods for forming 3D cell aggregates and differentiating them into specific tissue types will be developed, (vi) protocols for differentiating hES cells into relevant cell types, in particular epithelial, neural, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, will be further developed. The focus on human stem cells will be newly complemented by experiments aimed at understanding the origin and development of the human embryo, which is closely related to the issue of pluripotent cells and the medical applications based on them.

Imaging methods have undergone a significant evolution in the last decade, with the advent of methods such as PET/MR and dual-energy CT, which allow to reduce the radiation burden and improve the detection and characterization of tumor lesions. Not only diagnostic imaging methods have been improved, but also invasive endovascular or intratumoral treatment techniques. The integration of the findings of these new diagnostic methods into the patient's therapeutic plan enables the individualization of procedures in modern oncological treatment. Minimally invasive radiological-oncological interventions not only use imaging methods during the procedure, but as the first of the therapeutic modalities, they can use a spectrum of advanced imaging methods to monitor treatment response. The question is whether earlier and more accurate diagnosis and targeted minimally invasive treatment leads to improved overall survival of patients or whether overall survival is at the expense of systemic cancer treatment.;EN;;academic, student

For example, for some IPPs, we still do not know the exact pathophysiology of the disease or the effective causal treatment. As far as lung tumours are concerned, although we have various therapeutic options available, the prognosis of patients is nevertheless serious. Therefore, it is very important to study lung tissue and, in particular, to try to create three-dimensional models of healthy and pathological lung tissue in the laboratory, in health and in disease, to better understand the course of these lung diseases and, if necessary, to be able to test newly developed drugs on these models, thus enabling the personalisation of treatment in the future to the patient's exact requirements. In this project we will model lung tissue subject to interstitial lung processes (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis) and tumour transformation. In order to understand the pathogenesis and personalize the model, it is extremely important to obtain human cells, which are the only ones relevant for understanding disease pathogenesis and finding new therapeutic options. Such cells can be used directly in the form of isolation of primary cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells can be derived from them and differentiated into terminally differentiated lung tissue cell types. Subsequently, the cells can be combined with a cellular carrier, decellularized lung extracellular matrix, which recapitulates the basic architecture and bioactivity of lung tissue. This will allow us to create a 3D model of lung tissue under laboratory conditions and use it for research purposes. Studying human lung tissue samples and laboratory generated lung models will allow a more detailed understanding of the interrelationships and functional relationships between cells under conditions of health and disease, specifically the pathogenesis of IPP and lung cancer.

Distorted perceptions of one's own body and distorted perceptions of emotions are among the prominent symptoms across PPD diagnoses and contribute significantly to the onset and maintenance of these illnesses. However, most studies focus on patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and patients with bulimia nervosa (MB) tend to be neglected. Moreover, the neural mechanisms behind the significant distortions in body and emotion perception in PPP have not been elucidated, which as a result hinders the modernization of treatment approaches for these diseases. In the proposed project, we will compare 30 women with MA, 30 women with MB, and 30 healthy women, using clinical testing, self-report, and two MRI tasks to analyze the neural networks involved in the perception of self and others. The first task focuses on body perception, the second on emotion perception/awareness. The goal is to uncover key variables involved in perceptual biases, such as alexithymia or emotion regulation. Furthermore, we will carefully analyze functional and effective brain connectivity within the circuits responsible for dysfunctional perception in PPP. By combining phenomenological and objective (fMRI) data, we aim to identify specific biomarkers associated with a particular type of distortion. In doing so, we aim to offer clues to a more individualized approach in the treatment of PPP. Finally, based on the obtained brain stem model, we will propose specific targets for non-invasive neurostimulation aimed at normalizing neural circuits related to self-/other-perception in MA and MB.;EN;;Employee

It is a civilization and age specific condition that many of us have to deal with in old age. The current standard treatment for knee pain caused by severe damage to articular cartilage is total joint replacement. An alternative is autologous chondrocyte implantation, which treats cartilage defects and degeneration. After two decades of development, chondrocyte implantation seems to have reached its maximum for treatment with only mild healing effects and only in very young patients, but does not provide true cartilage regeneration in old age. Clearly, in vitro cultured chondrocytes did not offer a definitive solution for patients. Autologous implantation of chondrocytes is a treatment therapy offered by some orthopaedic clinics, but also rejected or even suspended (e.g. FN Brno, https://www.fnbrno.cz/kultivovane-chondrocyty/t2388). Therefore, as a new approach to the treatment of cartilage defects and degeneration, we would like to carry out research and development of chondrocyte stimulation directly in cartilage. Self-healing activated directly in cartilage, the newly developed in situ stimulation of chondrocytes should reverse their deprivation, rejuvenate and restore their original function and stimulate their clonal growth.;EN;;Academic

A growing group of genes is associated with retinal degeneration, but understanding of their role in retinal biology is very limited. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a systemic, rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy with a prevalence of approximately 1:150,000 in North America and Europe. BBS is therefore the most common non-lethal ciliopathy, involving early onset visual impairment. All efforts to treat inherited retinal degeneration diseases, including BBS, have so far resulted in only minimal success. The main objective of the present project is to characterize the molecular pathogenesis of retinal degeneration in BBS and to propose pharmacological modulation to prevent vision loss. Our hypothesis is that progressive vision loss in BBS is a consequence of prolonged intense ER stress, and that identification of signaling pathways activated in response to this stress and leading to cell death and their pharmacological modulation can prevent the onset and progression of the disease. Because mouse models do not fully match the phenotype of human BBS disease, primarily due to interspecies differences, in this study we will develop a high throughput system involving retinal organoids and pigmented retinal cells differentiated from human pluripotent cells derived from BBS patients. We will then use this tool to functionally diagnose selected specific mutations in BBS and to screen small molecules to reverse their pathological phenotype.;EN;;Academic

Survival time is significantly reduced by late detection of the disease, high metastatic potential of tumor cells and their resistance to cytostatic therapy, and there is considerable heterogeneity in response to treatment and survival among PDAC patients. This clinical heterogeneity is probably due to differences in the biological properties of PDAC cells. The global goals of this project are 1) to establish and expand a biobank of patient PDAC cell lines, and 2) to use these unique patient lines to determine whether expression of molecular regulators of PDAC cell response to mitochondrial stress and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, together with mass spectrometric, metabolic, clinical, and histopathological data, can identify patients with different survival times and responses to treatment. We will analyze this complex data using advanced biostatistical methods and artificial intelligence approaches that can help identify key biological parameters. The outcome of the project is therefore the PDAC Biobank as a necessary platform for personalized pancreatic cancer research, and the identification of complex biological determinants correlated with longer survival and response to treatment.

Most of these cancers are unresectable, and therefore other treatment modalities such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are being introduced. However, despite the undeniable benefit, clinical outcomes of TACE treatment can vary significantly between patients. Currently, imaging methods complemented by cytotoxicity assays are used to assess therapeutic response. However, this rather mechanistic approach does not take into account the molecular biological changes that occur in liver tissue by TACE (inflammation, hypoxia, increased temperature or tissue destruction accompanied by systemic secretion of cytokines and microRNAs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and are involved in oncogenesis and progression of liver cancer as well as in these biological processes, could represent ideal biomarkers.

Although these are relatively small numbers, these are individuals of working age whose prognosis is very poor and the pathogenesis of this disease is not satisfactorily understood. Often these are non-smokers or relatively short smokers, so a different causation of the cancer may be considered compared with older patients. Moreover, most patients in this age subgroup are diagnosed with aggressive forms of lung cancer. The genetic background of lung cancer occurring in patients younger than 40 years of age is poorly studied and only a higher incidence of EML4-ALK translocations in non-small cell lung cancer and EGFR gene mutations has been described in the literature. However, our preliminary analyses also revealed potentially targetable mutations in the genes for BRAF, PIK3CA or HER2 gene amplification. Therefore, advanced diagnosis of genetic aberrations in a subset of lung cancer patients under 40 years of age could help identify new potential targets for cancer therapy. The proposed project will be implemented as a multicentre patient recruitment trial, with the aim of a comprehensive analysis of molecular genetic alterations in early lung cancer. It will seek to identify a spectrum of possible genetic aberrations in tumor tissue beyond the commonly tested drivers (EGFR mutation and ALK translocation) using next generation sequencing (hotspot oncology panel, germline exome, somatic exome, fusion gene detection). The results obtained should not only increase the current level of scientific knowledge on the etiopathogenesis of lung cancer, but also significantly expand the therapeutic options within individualized treatment plans after the exhaustion of standard treatment options in young lung cancer patients.;EN;;Academic

In the Czech Republic, the situation is similar, with up to 1022 cases reported annually over the last decade. Syphilis is mostly diagnosed on the basis of a combination of clinical examination, anamnestic data and serological test results. Although serological tests are highly sensitive and specific, they have the disadvantage of false-negative results in the early stages of infection (when adaptive immunity is not sufficiently developed), as well as false-positivity of non-treponemal tests in other systemic diseases, or false-negativity of these tests in the case of the so-called 'prozone' effect. In previous studies, we have shown that direct diagnosis of syphilis by PCR detection of TPA DNA in skin and mucosal swabs (but not in whole blood samples) achieved a sensitivity of 76.4%, indicating that direct detection of TPA DNA has comparable sensitivity to indirect serological detection. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to develop a direct diagnostic method to detect TPA components directly in biological material (especially in whole blood samples, which are routinely collected for syphilis diagnosis). The main objectives of the project are the development of a direct diagnostic method for TPA based on the detection of DNA and RNA molecules, the development of new protocols for the detection of TPA (modules I-IV) and the development of a direct diagnostic method using samples with enriched treponemal DNA.

However, usually abrupt discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is successful in only about half of patients, and in the remaining patients, discontinuation may cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms in up to 30% of cases. Sustained deep molecular response (DMR) as a prerequisite for attempted discontinuation is achieved in only 20-40% of all CML patients, so most of them are still referred to long-term, costly treatment, burdened with the risk of even very serious side effects. Also, no robust clinical or biological predictor of successful discontinuation has yet been identified. The present multicentre academic Phase II trial (HALF) represents an original concept of a two-phase stepwise dose reduction of a TKI (i.e. to half of the standard dose in the first half of the study, followed by administration of this already reduced dose on each day in the second half of the study) prior to their actual discontinuation, with the ambition to i) increase the proportion of patients achieving successful TFR, ii) reduce the incidence and/or severity of withdrawal syndrome symptoms, iii) identify clinical and biological factors associated with successful TFR, including correlation of previously unexplored aspects in relation to TFR (somatic mutations, pharmacokinetic analysis, etc.), iv) to conduct a unique, previously unperformed, discontinuation study on a national scale thanks to the participation of all centres of specialised haematological care in the country, and last but not least v) to confirm the efficacy and safety of a gradual and, in effect, significant dose reduction of TKIs as an acceptable and optimal alternative to complete discontinuation for most patients, which vi) will result in a reduction of economic costs both for the treatment itself and for the management of situations related to adverse effects of therapy.;EN;;Employee

The term neonatal sepsis is used to describe a systemic disease of bacterial, viral or fungal origin that is associated with significant haemodynamic changes and clinical manifestations resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Conventional laboratory tests such as haemoculture, leukocyte indices, acute phase reactants and heart rate have limits in diagnostic accuracy in neonatal sepsis, particularly low positive predictive value. These limits, combined with equivocal clinical signs that overlap with signs of immaturity, often force neonatologists to exclude sepsis from the differential diagnostic process. However, if antibiotic therapy is deployed only when the clinical manifestations are complete, the prognosis is unfavourable; on the other hand, liberal antibiotic policy leads to an increase in resistance of microorganisms.

Ph.D.;12972;not approved. invest.;01.01.2022;31.12.2026;Recipient;GA BLACK / JUNIOR STAR;LF;Research group of David Šmajs;Conventional methods for analyzing cell populations rely on fluorescent labeling of surface antigens by flow cytometry, such as CD34 expression in hematopoietic cells. However, the expression of these markers does not correlate with the success of therapy-transplantation. Assessment of the mechanical properties of cells has emerged as a means of obtaining information on the functional status of cells without the use of fluorescent labels. Cell stiffness is influenced by the cell cycle, differentiation, pathological processes such as malignant transformation or immune cell activation. Mechano-phenotyping is thus applicable to clinical areas - to identify hematopoietic stem cells or to analyze tumor cell progression. The currently used methods for the analysis of mechanical properties of cells are limited by low robustness or the need for highly expert operators (atomic force microscopy - AFM, etc.) and are not suitable for application in clinical diagnostics. The proposed approach extends the capabilities of quantitative phase microscopy by hardware modifications and computational methods for characterizing the shear stress response of cells, the so-called shear modulus. The method is feasible at sufficient robustness (hundreds-thousands of cells/hour), and does not require specialized consumables or highly specialized operators.;EN;;Academic

By 2050, the number of Alzheimer's dementia patients in the Czech Republic is expected to double to 300 000.  In the early stages, patients can remain in their own environment without major problems, but gradually the risk of failure in normal daily activities increases. Later on, a significant loss of independence develops, with the need for constant supervision and, of course, an increase in the complexity of the patient's care. This situation usually requires the elderly person to be placed in a social care facility such as a care home. However, the capacity of these facilities is limited and many caring families also want to continue to care for their elderly person, even though they have to manage their jobs at the same time. It is therefore important to be able to safely prolong the elderly person's ability to stay in their own environment. To prevent or solve these problems, various electronic aids with sensors and communication devices are being developed - flexible wearable devices for monitoring. Parameters monitored typically include basic vital signs, patient movement, fall signalling and interfacing with the caregiver and/or integrated rescue system. Progressive miniaturisation has made it possible to put the necessary technology into a wristwatch-sized device. This technology has already been tested at our institution as part of the NEUROSMART project, but most seniors with dementia encounter problems with the use of wristband technology. Seniors with dementia find it difficult to get used to new things in their environment and even more difficult on their bodies, i.e. they repeatedly remove and hide the bracelet, which causes false alarms and threatens the safety of the senior themselves. Furthermore, especially when paranoid, they consider the bracelet to be a tool of someone who is watching them, which causes them to become anxious or even delirious. The optimal solution seems to be to place the electronic technology on a part of the body where the senior cannot see or reach. The use of the back area in the shoulder blade region is suggested, with the development of a sufficiently miniature device and a sufficiently effective material to mount it for at least 48 hours. Thus, the project aims to optimize the adhesive material used and the miniaturization of the sensors, to improve the handling methods and thus the viability of the whole process from the perspective of AD patients and their caregivers, as well as to optimize the sensitivity and the data acquisition and power supply method;EN;;Academic

However, current methods of preclinical testing and quality control do not sufficiently assess the effect of prospective drugs on the developmental potential of the human embryo and thus exclude any risk to fertility. As the investigational use of human embryos is not possible for ethical reasons, toxicological testing in animal models is carried out. However, due to significant interspecies differences, it is unclear whether these results are also relevant with respect to human reproduction. The need to expand existing embryotoxicity testing options is particularly acute in the field of assisted reproduction. Here, in vitro culture conditions are being modified to increase treatment efficacy without standardised assessment of the influence of media components and so-called critical materials in direct contact with the developing embryo. The aim of the proposed project is to validate the applicability of an existing in vitro model of human embryogenesis for pharmacological and toxicological testing.  For this purpose, we will make use of a recently published technology that allows the laboratory preparation of 3D structures resembling human embryos at the blastocyst stage (so-called blastoids) from in vitro cultured human stem cells (Fig. 1). The existence of this laboratory system opens up a wide range of applications not only for the research of new drugs and the improvement of in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques, but also for the quality and safety control of products used in current clinical practice.

The unclear cause of the disease, together with clinical heterogeneity, are the main reasons why CVID is often mis- or underdiagnosed.

In Eastern European Medical Programmes taught in English, however, the number of international students has exploded in the last decade, while the number of teaching staff has not been increased reasonably. The teaching workload of academics increased enormously, without meaningful adjustments in teaching traditions sustainable for large heterogenous populations of international students. This has resulted in considerably high rates of mental health-related complaints from both students and academic staff in these Institutions. As the medical profession itself is notoriously linked to a relatively high lifetime risk for mental health and associated chronic diseases, and medical education ought to equip all doctors with skills to cope with these increased risks in a preventive or protective way, strategic investments must target the development of the curricula of foundational years in medical education which should help transform current teaching traditions into a sustainable and efficient training beyond ESG standards. To facilitate achieving this goal, this project investigates a key foundational course subject Human Anatomy for its potential to be repurposed for the above-mentioned sustainability criteria. The key intellectual output of this project will be a guidebook on 'How to Manage Human Anatomy Courses for Internationalized and Sustainable Medical Education'.

Cell death acts as a second messenger, influencing the immune system and the tissue microenvironment to ensure regeneration and homeostasis. The most important subtypes of cell death are apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis and ferroptosis. The distinction between lytic (cell rupture) and non-lytic (apoptosis) cell death induced by agents used in medicine is extremely important information for many areas of medicine. Currently, the widely used biochemical endpoint assays are not accurate enough to distinguish the specific type of cell death, and therefore new more accurate methods are needed. In this project, we will attempt to demonstrate that real-time quantitative phase imaging can provide robust data for deep learning methods. In addition to robust deep learning detection/classification, standard feature extraction techniques will be explored to produce explainable data and a novel feature describing quantitative phase dynamics will be investigated. Simultaneously acquired, cell death-specific fluorescence will be used as a control for subsequent cell death detection and classification from fluorescently unlabeled cells. This approach can provide important information about the cell population after exposure to a particular substance, such as the number of dead cells, and distinguish the major subtypes of cell death that led to their demise.;EN;;Academic

Biofilms are able to colonise both biological surfaces, such as wounds or burns, but also abiotic surfaces, such as medical devices like catheters, heart valves, joint replacements, etc., where they increase the risk of chronic infections.;EN;;Academic

It is based on sensing the electrical activity of the heart by an orthogonal lead system measured by surface electrodes. The lead system does not take into account the influence of the position of the heart and its electrical centre relative to the centre of the orthogonal lead system. This causes a bias in the measured values which will affect further analysis of the measured signals. For vectorcardiograph analysis, it is advantageous to use Laufberger number interpretation, the calculation of which is sensitive to the displacement of the heart's electrical vector. At the same time, interpretation in 3D space using virtual reality can be advantageously used for vectorcardiograph analysis, thus substantially advancing the methodology of vectorcardiography and expanding it in clinical practice.;EN;;student

During the preoperative evaluation, identification of the ""epileptogenic zone"" (EZ) is crucial for its subsequent removal. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, defined in the 80-500 Hz band) have previously been introduced as a promising, interictal (seizure-independent) biomarker of the epileptogenic zone. In recent years, our group has demonstrated the occurrence of very high frequency oscillations (VHFOs, defined in the 500-2000 Hz band) with seemingly higher specificity for EZ than traditional HFOs. This project focuses on basic research on electrophysiological symptoms above the current 500 Hz threshold in a large multi-center dataset. We will use macro-electrodes in vivo, micro-electrodes in vivo and micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) ex vivo to study the generation and propagation of these high frequency events.

Disturbances in the segregation of homologous chromosomes in the first meiotic division are one of the major molecular causes of aneuploidy, which is responsible for infertility and severe birth defects in humans. The construction of the bipolar division spindle in mammalian oocytes is synergistically controlled by chromosomes involved in RanGTP signaling, multiple microtubule-organizing centers that functionally replace the centrosome found in somatic cells, and newly discovered domains around the division spindle, termed liquid-like spindle domains (LISDs). A family of protein kinases, the Aurora kinases, plays an important role in the construction of the division spindle and chromosome segregation. Using advanced live cell microscopy techniques, we will elucidate in more detail 1) the role of LISD-localized Aurora kinase C in meiotic maturation of mouse oocytes, 2) the interaction of Aurora kinases with RanGTP in the construction of the dividing spindle, and 3) how Aurora kinase A regulates meiotic maturation in human oocytes.;EN;;Academic

Deviations in metabolism are therefore one of the key features of tumors and a potential therapeutic target. In prostate cancer, compared to most other cancers, oxidative phosphorylation is still the dominant source of ATP production. Maintaining functional mitochondria is therefore crucial. Prostate cancer cells are also specific in terms of biomechanics; an increase in cellular stiffness compared to non-tumor tissue is typical. Although the properties of the plasma membrane with its associated cytoskeleton and the nucleus are mainly involved in cellular stiffness, intracellular organelles may also contribute to the increase in cellular stiffness. Based on our data, a high degree of cross-linking of the mitochondrial network is evident. In light of the abundance of mitochondria and their high fusion and connectivity rates with the cytoskeleton, it would be surprising if these organelles did not play a role in increasing stiffness. Although this is advantageous in terms of ATP production, it may be a factor limiting migration and invasiveness for cancer cells.";EN;;Academic

If this response is unregulated, it can induce further damage to fine tissue structures or fibroticisation of these structures, subsequently leading to reduced or failed lung function and an increased risk of other lung diseases such as lung tumours, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms that control the response to metabolic stress is important for successful regeneration of lung tissue. In this project, we will use a unique model of expandable lung epithelial cells (ELEP) to interrogate the molecular response of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to metabolic stress, and to understand the dynamics of progenitor cell metabolism during differentiation into functional lung cell types.;EN;;Academic

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by tumor cells may promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and their metabolic shift towards autophagy and aerobic glycolysis. CAFs may promote HNSCC progression, for example, by secreting certain cytokines whose secretion may be involved in autophagy. Modulation of autophagy may affect the amount and content of EVs produced. Several studies have shown that EVs produced by cancer cells expose phosphatidylserine (PS) on their surface. In this project, we want to investigate the role of autophagy in oncogenic communication. The effect of conditioned medium containing EVs (derived from tumor cells with and without autophagy inhibition) on the metabolism of untransformed fibroblasts and CAFs of HNSCC patients will be studied. Furthermore, protein composition of PS-positive EV secreted from tumor cells (with and without autophagy inhibition) and cytokine production in CAFs with high/low basal levels of autophagy will be studied.;EN;;Academic

Mechanical forces are an integral part of the regulatory mechanisms, but their role in mammary gland morphogenesis and tumorigenesis has not been adequately studied. In this study, we will investigate how mechanical force exerted by stromal fibroblasts regulates mammary epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis using 3D co-cultures of organoids with fibroblasts, advanced imaging techniques, mouse models and transcriptomics. The proposed experiments build on our expertise on mammary fibroblast function and our original findings that mechanical force exerted by fibroblasts induces branching morphogenesis of the mammary epithelium and shapes tumor spheroids ex vivo, and that mechanically active fibroblasts are found in the mammary gland in vivo. This research will provide valuable insights into the role of stromal mechanosignaling in mammary gland development, function, and cancer.;EN;;student, employee

In 2018, for the first time, a system allowing the cultivation of TPA-related treponemes under in vitro conditions was published. The primary goal of this project is to use the treponemal culture system under in vitro conditions as a source of live treponemes for the study of genetic manipulation and for the study of the pathogenesis of treponemal infections. We plan to study the genetic transformability of T. pallidum and test basic methods applicable to genetic manipulation of treponemes. In parallel, we also plan to study the interaction of treponem with eukaryotic cells and with extracellular matrix components using chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry methods. In addition, we plan to use antibodies that interact with outer membrane proteins of living treponemes as keys to identify components of the outer membrane of treponemes responsible for the structural and functional properties of pathogenic T. pallidum species and subspecies.;EN;;academic, student

During this process, exons are recognized by the splicing apparatus, excised from the pre-mRNA and rejoined to form mature mRNA. The actual splicing takes place in two consecutive steps (trans-esterification reactions), both of which must be fully completed for the reaction to proceed successfully. However, the efficiency of the two steps varies and is likely controlled by the sequence specificity of the splice sites. It is thought that some donor splice sites undergo the first step but not the second. The splice intermediates thus formed would likely be the substrate for RNA degradation, and this mechanism would thus be responsible for a number of processes occurring in the cell, such as selection of the correct splice site, alternative splicing, or regulation of gene expression. The aim of the project is to distinguish donor splice sites subject only to the first reaction from those subject to both steps on the basis of their sequence. This would have a major impact on the diagnosis of genetic diseases as it would allow the identification of mutations affecting mRNA splicing that otherwise go undetected.;EN;;Academic

So far, three types of these receptors have been identified and characterized - types 1, 2 and 3 - which differ in function. In cancer cells, IP3 type 1 and 2 receptors are known to have antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, whereas the function of type 3 receptors is reversed. The intercommunication and modulation of the different types of IP3 is not yet known. Therefore, the aim of this project is to elucidate the communication of the different types of IP3 receptors in tumorigenesis. We also hypothesize that the mutual communication of IP3 receptors may influence the sensitivity to different chemotherapeutic drugs, which we intend to study in this project. Three types of cancer cell lines will be used in this project - stable cell lines derived from colorectal cancer cells as well as ovarian and breast cancer cells. The results obtained may explain the mechanism of IP3 receptor communication and their role in chemotherapeutic interventions.;EN;;Academic

Recently, we observed an unusual, potentially arrhythmogenic dual effect of the addictive ethanol and the drug aminophylline on IK1 channels in rat heart cells. Our pilot data also showed that low Ba2+ concentrations (common in the population) significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of the drug sildenafil on IK1 in rat cardiac cells and in expressed human Kir2.1 channels. These effects have not been described to date. This project will provide a detailed cross-species analysis of the effects of these agents on rat and human/pig cardiac cells. In addition to recording IK1 and action voltages (AN) in enzymatically isolated adult cardiac cells, complex electrical activity (AN and multielectrode array) of cardiac cells differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (both 2D culture and artificial heart tissue) will be recorded. Not only acute but also chronic effects will be tested.

Recent genomic studies have revealed that pathogenic strains have evolved from commensals and thus E. coli represents a continuous set of strains rather than two strictly separate groups of beneficial and harmful isolates. Resident strains of E. coli are considered non-pathogenic, but share some genetic characteristics with pathogens and are also characterised by long-term colonisation of the human gut. It is therefore important to pay attention to the impact of these strains on host health. The aim of this project is to analyse the impact of resident E. coli on eukaryotic cells and to identify the corresponding genetic markers. To this end, the negative effects of E. coli strains originating from healthy individuals will be tested against several eukaryotic cell lines in vitro.

Here we suggest groundbreaking new concept of stemness being a fluidic ability that can be acquired, modified, or lost under precisely controlled mechanisms. This concept offers a functional substitution of deterministic view of adult stem cells and suggests an unappreciated heterogeneity in stem cell niche by perpetual fluctuation in stem cell behavior. We designed a complex cutting-edge approach to address stem cell dynamics in vivo on the model of continuously growing mouse teeth with a direct translation to regenerative dentistry. To achieve this ambitious goal, we will combine full-length single-cell transcriptome profiling, advanced bioinformatic analysis, in vivo functional validation including multicolor lineage fate mapping or developing a unique system enabling to observe interaction and mutual conversion of stemness niche - stem cell fluidity in vivo. Our findings will have a direct impact on the rapidly developing field of regenerative medicine and will accelerate tissue engineering techniques by understanding intricate behavior of stem cells in vivo and explaining altered behavior of stem cells in vitro.;EN;;Academic

Importantly, the manifestation of cognitive decline is preceded by a long preclinical phase, i.e. the overall disease process is likely to take several decades (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The failure of hundreds of clinical trials focused on AD treatment highlights the importance of introducing new analytical strategies and novel methods to investigate this disease from a new perspective. In this project, we aim to combine expertise in stem cell biology, single cell sequencing and electrophysiology to map the molecular and physiological initiation and development of AD in brain organoids. We hypothesize that specific genes, molecular pathways, and/or cell types are altered during the early stages of AD and that these previously undescribed changes lead to amyloid accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation. We believe that specific study of the initiation steps of AD could reveal novel mechanisms that could be highly relevant for the prevention and/or treatment of AD in the future.;EN;;Employee

Even though there are methods available to measure the stress resilience, very few tools are available that would make it possible to reliably categorize a population based on the stress resilience of its individuals. This can have consequences especially in high stress situations such as combat scenarios, where it is only after the event where we are able to assess the resilience - however, to prevent the adverse outcome of the high-stress stimulus it is necessary to predict stress resilience before the event actually occurs. Overall, this project focuses on monitoring stress and stress resilience in various scenarios by by established physiological and psychological markers of stress and stress resilience as well as by our novel methodology for stress measurement. Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience. The main goal of the study is to devise a method based on multiple layers of data (physiological markers of stress, neuroimaging, psychological data) making it possible to distinguish between more and less stress resilient individuals.

Thereby, ERK signaling is essential for tissue development, and dysregulation of ERK signaling leads to cancer. But how does signaling activity of one molecule, ERK, defines so many diverse outcomes? Current evidence suggests that the information for very specific cellular responses is encoded in complex spatiotemporal patterns of the activity of ERK molecules - oscillations of various amplitude, frequency and duration, that are only beginning to become understood. It remains largely elusive, how ERK signaling executes the divergent functions during the complex events of organ development and tumorigenesis.

First, it brings an opportunity to establish an interdisciplinary Chem-Bio-Detect consortium of research groups capable of highly competitive research in bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry. Besides the group leaders, postdoc researchers and students for each partner will participate in the project, which will boost their personal development and contribute significantly to their scientific careers. Second, the research project is focused on the tailored development of advanced functional supramolecular anticancer metallodrugs (SAMs) and screening of their biological effects in precise tumor models - namely determination of cytotoxicity and anti-metastatic potential of SAMs using two- and three-dimensional cell culture systems and using animal models in the later stage. Detailed analyses of biological samples for determination of cellular uptake of metals (from in vitro tests), identification of subcellular target(s), and studies of the lateral distribution of elements in tissue samples (from in vivo tests) will provide additional information crucial for the future rational design of more effective and selective SAMs. Following the evaluation of IP protection, the results will be published in top-tier journals. The ultimate goal of the NANOWHEEL project is to set a base for a structure-activity relationship investigation of the developed SAM and establish an internationally competitive research center attracting prestigious research grants and talented young researchers.;EN;;Academic

The bicarbonate ions are transported inside cells, contributing to the maintenance of physiological intracellular pH, while accumulating protons make the extracellular environment more acidic. CAIX is highly expressed in advanced solid tumors, where its activity promotes cancer cell migration and the formation of metastases. It also helps cancer cells to survive under hypoxia and the conditions of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Therefore, CAIX is a highly attractive therapeutic target for developing novel, more effective treatments for advanced human cancers with fewer undesired side effects. The proposed project will combine unique expertise in computational chemistry and biology, structural biology, medicinal chemistry, and cancer biology to develop novel highly selective small-molecule CAIX inhibitors as potential anti-cancer drugs. We will use state-of-the-art molecular modeling and NMR spectroscopy structural biology approaches to study in a wide pH range the functionally essential, but little characterized, intrinsically disordered region of the extracellular domain of CAIX. Subsequent SPR binding analyses will identify its critical structural determinants. Informed by the structural studies and molecular modeling results, the medicinal chemistry group will develop effective synthetic routes for the preparation of selected novel triazinyl-substituted benzenesulfonamides as specific CAIX inhibitors, followed by in vitro activity testing. Analyses of the compounds' biological activity in human malignant melanoma and breast carcinoma cells under conditions representing different bioenergetic/metabolic contexts found in cancer tissues will synergistically complement the whole process. Moreover, the planned analyses of CAIX molecular and functional interactions with other essential regulators of intracellular pH could help to identify conditions under which the cytotoxic activity of CAIX inhibitors towards cancer cells is potentiated.;EN;;Academic

The Czech government reacted swiftly and decisively and implemented a lockdown in mid-March. This helped keep the number of infected very low throughout the first wave of the pandemic. Day-to-day life across the country was thus affected rather by the anti-pandemic measures than by the disease per se. These measures created several natural experiments which we exploit in this project to evaluate various public policies that would be unfeasible under normal circumstances. In the wake of the pandemic, the government introduced a ban on support persons during childbirth and imposed restrictions on outdoor activities. In the first work package, we study the effect of continuous support during childbirth on the health outcomes of mothers and children. Employing the rich health registry data and the unexpected introduction of the ban of support persons during childbirth, we identify the effect of continuous support on health outcomes. Other work packages involve the restrictions imposed on outdoor activities during the lockdown. Such restrictions can be seen as a stand-in for a potential air pollution avoidance policy. However, unlike in other countries, the air quality following the lockdown substantially worsened in the Czech Republic. In the second work package, we thus identify the effect of a potential air pollution avoidance policy using a within-subject comparison of the probability of acute conditions occurring pre- and post-lockdown with a previous comparable period of air pollution increase that was unaffected by COVID-19 related restrictions. In the third work package, we study the effect of air pollution on traffic accidents using the health and Police registry data. The restrictions on outdoor activities imposed during the lockdown enable us to disentangle the effects of air pollution and traffic intensity.;EN;;Academic

Systemic therapy for this disease consists mainly of four drugs - 5-FU, capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The 5-year survival rate for CRC is only 53% in the Czech Republic. Therefore, new drugs and innovative models for their testing are needed. Agents inhibiting signaling pathways deregulated in CRC, such as EGFR/KRAS/BRAF, were suggested for the treatment of CRC patients. However, the success of this targeted therapy depends on the mutation profile of the tumor, the homogeneity of drug penetration, the tumor microenvironment, the cell-stroma interactions, and other factors. The organotypic slice cultures (OTSC) represent a new 3D model for drug testing, comprising not only the individual mutational spectrum of a primary tumor but also other characteristics such as acidity, hypoxia, and intercellular interactions. Derived from a tumor of an individual patient, OTSC is a model of choice for personalized medicine.;EN;;Academic

The personalized treatment procedures are based on detailed examination of the specific disease, its evolution over time (repeated biopsies - clonal evolution), biological analysis and genetic background of the patient. For this purpose, both commercially available and ""in-house"" academic procedures based on molecular biology technologies are used. Data are subjected to bioinformatic analysis, which forms an integral part of these so-called theranostic approaches.    Biological material is analysed by next-generation whole exome/genome sequencing (NGS), transcriptional profiling (RNAseq), detection of receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and detection of specific translocations/gene fusions. The panel of assays has been expanded in the last 2 years to include methylome sequencing, liquid biopsies and MLPA, and low-coverage whole-exome sequencing prior to launch. The information obtained is evaluated in regular expert meetings, the so-called expert panel (""molecular tumor board""), which results in specific treatment recommendations to improve outcomes for patients with high-risk cancers, such as children with refractory and relapsed solid tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL).

Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field in which this knowledge is used to combine stem/progenitor cells with bioactive materials and flow systems. However, the effective use of any stem cell type is completely dependent on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence stem cell behavior, our ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into functional somatic cell types, or our ability to generate and influence the three-dimensional arrangement of stem and progenitor cells. The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, (i) the molecular mechanisms responsible for genetic instability and genetic modifications of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, (ii) methods for isolation and characterization of the extracellular matrix and their impact on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, and (iii) microfluidic systems will be developed to coculture multiple types of stem and progenitor cells, (iv) the involvement of miRNA molecules in controlling differentiation and establishing stem cell plasticity will be investigated, (v) methods for forming 3D cell aggregates and differentiating them into specific tissue types will be developed, (vi) protocols for differentiating hES cells into relevant cell types, in particular epithelial, neural, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, will be further developed. The focus on human stem cells will be newly complemented by experiments aimed at understanding the origin and development of the human embryo, which is closely related to the issue of pluripotent cells and the medical applications based on them. The main experimental approaches will be in vitro manipulation of cells, quantification of relevant mRNAs and proteins for molecular phenotyping of cell populations, and imaging of live and fixed cells using advanced microscopy techniques.;EN;;Academic

The subject of this project is the molecular genetic diagnosis of idiopathic PAS by Sequence capture (SeqCap) and Targeted resequencing (TR) to identify causal mutations, i.e. mutations directly responsible for the development of the disease. The identification of causal PAS mutations is followed by the study of genotype-phenotype correlations, focusing on the current incidence or risk of epilepsy, in an attempt to determine the predictive value of specific mutations in relation to epilepsy. Determining the risk of epilepsy for a given causal PAS mutation is important in terms of initiating preventive regimens and therapeutic interventions in these patients, thus preventing complications, poor prognosis and quality of life in these children.;EN;;Academic

In a unique way, we described the dependence of the ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) value, which is a numerical expression of the diffusivity of water molecules on MRI, with cellularity and vascularity in the peritumoral tissue. Based on these findings, we attempted to delineate areas of brain tissue that is infiltrated by a significant amount of diffusely growing tumor cells leading to restriction of the free movement of water molecules. However, our promising results have a limited level of significance given the limited number of samples. Thus, we proposed a method in which the dynamics of ADC value evolution towards the periphery of tumor infiltration forms the basis for tumor boundary prediction. The extent of tumor infiltration according to imaging methods will be subsequently verified by retrospective analysis of anonymized histological samples obtained topically during neurosurgical procedures. Refining the delineation of high-grade glial neoplasia is currently one of the greatest challenges in the management of these tumors. If our method proves successful, it could contribute to a higher efficiency of surgical and subsequent oncological treatment in high-grade gliomas. The use of the method in the differential diagnosis of other brain tumor and non-tumor entities, where rote imaging methods often fail, could also be beneficial.;EN;;Academic

These are generally available in a few strengths (defined doses), disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences between patients, e.g., genetics, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, biorhythms, or human biotype. Individualised therapy is an area of pharmaceutical research that reflects such differences.  However, to fully develop this concept, there is a need for adequate dosage forms allowing precise administration of drugs. New technologies to produce medicinal products are being introduced, with the emphasis on the flexibility of dosing and high patient acceptability. One group of such technologies are printing technologies - e.g., 2D ink-jet or 3D printing. These may be used for the preparation of thin polymeric films, which provide good compliance and treatment adherence along with high formulation flexibility. Printing technologies ensure the deposition of an accurate dose of the drug into a dosage form while allowing to combine several drugs or fine-tune release kinetics. Although printing may help to fulfil one of the goals of the presented project, bringing the personalisation approach directly to healthcare facilities has still some downsides. These are mainly the lack of a simple user interface for the control of printers and basically non-existent legal framework for the whole process.  Hence this project aims: 1) to verify the application of ink-jet and 3D printing in the manufacturing of oral films, 2) to improve the user-friendliness of 2D and 3D printers control software, and 3) to clarify the legislative framework of the complex issue of individualised therapy.

Choroid plexuses (CPs) of the brain ventricles play a crucial role in brain homeostasis maintenance. Besides the secretion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the epithelial cells of CP form the blood-CSF (B-CSF) barrier, an interface between the circulating blood and CSF.  Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence implying the involvement of the CP and B-CSF barrier in different neurological disorders such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), nerve injury, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and Alzheimer’s disease. However, the B-CSF barrier is among the least studied structures of the central nervous system (CNS) despite its clinical importance. 
Our group has been focused on investigating the pathology and therapeutic potential of the CP and B-CSF barrier using in-vivo and in-vitro (cell lines grown as monolayers on flat surfaces) models. Our in-vitro cell models (Z310 cell line and primary cells) aim to reproduce B-CSF barrier functionality, plus allow for genetic manipulation and enable us to study and control the passage of active component through the barrier in order to understand its properties at the cellular and molecular level. 
In-vitro two-dimensional (2D) culture systems, in general, are simple, fast, and cost-effective; however, the 2D culture system does not resemble the environment in which cells experience in the brain tissue. Therefore, a significant difference between the 2D cell monolayers and in-vivo characteristics has been reported. Impaired cell-cell communication and reduced intercellular contacts are among the limiting factors of a 2D culture. Nevertheless, three-dimensional (3D) systems can capture complex physiological responses and could closely resemble in-vivo conditions. 
The goal of this project is to develop 3D CP epithelial cell culture and 3D blood-barin barrier (BBB) model employing tissue engineering techniques and biomaterials in order to support advanced studies on the structure and function of the B-CSF barrier in physiological and pathological conditions.";EN;;Academic

And while the current body of research supports the concept that protein aggregation initiates the onset of AD, failure of over 413 clinical trials performed thus far that aimed to treat AD highlights the importance of introducing novel analytical strategies and methods to explore this disease from a new unbiased perspective. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to determine which molecules, molecular pathways, and cell types are altered during the initial phase of AD development and use this knowledge to validate markers (and possibly “druggable targets”) of early disease onset. Specifically, we aim to 1) perform single-cell sequencing of our established functional AD-iPSCs-based model of brain organoids in the timeline experiments; 2) use unbiased data analysis to reveal molecules, molecular pathways, and cell types that are altered during the initiation of AD pathogenesis and pinpoint the relevant AD-driver change(s); and 3) evaluate if any of these novel findings could be used as early disease onset marker or possibly as AD drug-targets and perform functional studies of selected molecules. To this date, such single-cell seq analysis of AD-brain organoids has not been performed, nor has any of the available single-cell seq research from post-mortem AD-brains addressed the initial steps leading to the manifestation of AD pathology. Thus we believe that this project could significantly contribute to solving the initial trigger that stands behind the early steps of AD pathogenesis.";EN;;Academic

Thereby, ERK signaling is essential for mammary gland development, including, and dysregulation of ERK signaling leads to breast cancer. However, it remains largely elusive, how ERK signaling executes the divergent functions during breast development and cancerogenesis. We hypothesize that specific patterns of ERK signaling dynamics encode distinct morphological processes during mammary gland development, determine different cancer cell behaviors, and confer differences in therapeutic susceptibilities and prognosis. 
The overall objective of this project is to decipher the ERK activity dynamics code in mammary gland development and breast cancer. To this end, we aim to 1) uncover the ERK activity dynamics patterns during mammary morphogenesis and cancer progression using state-of-the-art bioimaging approaches with highly sensitive ERK biosensors in developmentally and clinically highly relevant in vivo and ex vivo models; 2) decipher the ERK dynamics code by tracking the cellular and molecular outcomes of ERK activity dynamics by analyzing gene expression and protein abundance patterns using non-targeted and targeted approaches; and 3) validate our findings by perturbation analysis using specific inhibitors to modulate ERK signaling in normal and cancer cells. 
The proposed experimental techniques with cellular resolution, ranging from ERK biosensor to single-cell transcriptome and spatial transcriptomic analyses, hold the promise to elucidate the relationship between ERK activity dynamics, morphogenesis and cancerogenesis while considering cellular heterogeneity. Our research collaboration will provide essential, in-depth insights in the basic biology of this crucial signaling pathway during mammary gland development and breast cancer progression. In the era of precision medicine, our findings will shed light on mechanisms of normal and neoplastic breast cell heterogeneity and lead to the development of new rational, tailored treatment strategies and predictions of therapeutic responses for breast cancer patients.";EN;;Academic

Kidney transplantation represents the gold standard for patients with ESRD. After transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs are crucial to reducing the risk for organ rejection. Apart from this desired effect, the compromised immunocompetence of the recipient leads to an increased risk for infectious disease. Moreover current immunosuppression regimens are unable to sufficiently control allorecognition of the graft, which leads to chronic rejection. Thus optimal management of immunosuppressive drug dosing requires a delicate balance between inadequate and excessive immunosuppression. At present, there is no diagnostic test or algorithm for optimal guidance of immunosuppressive drugs. Monitoring relies on the quantification of calcineurin inhibitor, mostly tacrolimus, through levels in the peripheral blood, which correlate more closely with the risk of drug-related toxicity than the immunosuppressive efficacy. There is an urgent need for tools to personalise immunosuppression thereby reducing the risk of infectious disease and, at the same time, graft rejection.";EN;;Academic

The disease is characterized by chromosome fragility, premature aging, developmental abnormalities and predisposition to cancer. RecQ4 participates in several cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA damage response, telomere and mitochondrial maintenance. However, it is not clear which impaired functions of RECQ4 trigger the pathogenic effects. We have identified several novel RecQ4 interacting partners mediated by the conserved N-terminal domain required for cell viability. Here we propose a multidisciplinary set of biochemical, biophysical, structural, cellular and genetic approaches to understand the molecular function of RecQ4 protein in cells and its correlation to disease development. We set three goals to unravel the roles of RecQ4 during replication and resolution of replication/recombination intermediates. Krejci’s lab will focus on biochemical characterization of the above-mentioned protein interactions and their effect on replication initiation and progression, as well as resolution of stalled intermediates in human cell lines. Tripsianes’ group will focus on structural and biophysical characterisation of interaction interfaces and identify separation of function mutants. Silva’s team will nicely complement the biological role of RecQ4 in the C.elegans model system. The proposed synergy promises to dissect RecQ4 multiple functions in genome maintenance, which in turn will offer a better understanding on the development of RECQ4 associated diseases.;EN;;Academic

Even though there are methods available to measure the stress resilience, very few tools are available that would make it possible to reliably categorize population based on the stress resilience of its individuals. This can have consequences especially in high stress situations such as combat scenarios, where it is only after the event where we are able to assess the resilience – however, to prevent the adverse outcome of the high-stress stimulus it is necessary to predict stress resilience before the event actually occurs. Overall, this project focuses on monitoring stress and stress resilience in various scenarios by by established physiological and psychological markers of stress and stress resilience as well as by our novel methodology for stress measurement. Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience. The main goal of the study is to devise a method based on multiple layers of data (physiological markers of stress, neuroimaging, psychological data) making it possible to distinguish between more and less stress resilient individuals.

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the molecular pathology of achondroplasia, and compromises development of treatment for this devastating human condition. 
Our previous work points to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. 
In the proposed research, we will use mathematical modelling and advanced computational analysis to reconstruct the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation, and to predict their behavior. The in silico analysis will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling. 
Unraveling the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK activation will aid development of novel treatments for achondroplasia. Because many other, FGFR3-unrelated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) utilize prolonged ERK activation in their pathological signaling, the theoretic and experimental work proposed here will advance the understanding of general mechanisms of developmental defects, cancer and other disorders caused by aberrant RTK activation.";EN;;Academic

Within this population, poor muscle control, impaired balance and spasticity cause significant motor impairments. To improve locomotion, a surgery is the key part of treatment, whose success strongly depends on a correct surgery indication. However, the selection of the convenient surgery is very difficult and subjective also for expert surgeons. On the other hand, current motion capture systems can accurately measure kinematic, kinetic and spatio-temporal parameters of gait (so-called 3D motion data). A manual analysis of such complex data is practically impossible in huge data volumes. Within this project, we propose to develop a prototype software application for automatic analysis and evaluation of 3D motion data using sophisticated technologies employing artificial intelligence. In particular, we plan to utilize current advances in deep neural networks to learn a locomotion model from 3D motion data of thousands of gait cycles of more than 500 patients operated in the past. The learned model will be used to find formerly-operated patients with the most similar walking patterns. By considering the treatment outcome of these known patients, we could recommend the most suitable surgery option for a new examined patient. We assume that a sophisticated similarity analysis of a huge amount of 3D motion data can be the critical factor in distinguishing patients with a good response from patients with a poor response to a specific surgery, which is not possible to do in any other way at the present time.

For adults, romantic partners are one of the most important social regulators of negative emotions, and experimental studies have shown that partner presence dampens emotional distress and neural reactivity during physical threat and pain. However, the modulating effects of social support during exposure to emotional visual stimuli and emotional imagery are still largely unexplored. Negative emotional imagery and exposure to grief-inducing visual material cause subjective stress and can compromise quality of life. Intrusive mental imagery is further prevalent in patients with mood and anxiety disorders and therefore has been given increasing scientific attention. Both peripheral and central neurophysiological underpinnings of negative imagery and whether these can be modulated has captured interest. Previous studies have used physical threats to induce discomfort, but during ordinary everyday life fantasies and images of aversive situations and outcomes are common and therefore in this project we aimed to study aversive mental imagery and exposure to visual reminders of deceased close person, and the effects of social support given by the attachment figure (romantic partner) and a stranger, on brain activity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), in order to assess the brain function at various levels. Such research is warranted in order to investigate brain reactivity and functional connectivity, that are specific for negative imagery and exposure to negative personal visual material and whether social support by a close person can modulate such potentially deleterious neural activity to this type of stressors. The findings can provide new leads in understanding possible health benefits stemming from social interactions and deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of attachment.

Intrusive mental imagery is further prevalent in patients with mood and anxiety disorders and therefore has been given increasing scientific attention. Both peripheral and central neurophysiological underpinnings of negative imagery and whether these can be modulated has captured interest. One way to dampen stress is to hold hands with an attachment figure, which attenuates both physical and psychological pain possibly through reduced neural activity. Most previous studies have used physical threats to induce discomfort, but during ordinary everyday life fantasies and images of aversive situations and outcomes are common and therefore in this project we aimed to study aversive mental imagery and exposure to visual reminders of deceased close person, and the effects of social touch given by the attachment figure (romantic partner) and a stranger, on brain activity. We used electroencephalographic (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and also the novel functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) technique, in order to assess the brain function at various levels. Such research is warranted in order to investigate brain reactivity, connectivity and neurotransmitter concentration changes, that are specific for negative imagery and negative personal visual stimulation and whether intimate hand holding can modulate such neural activity to this type of stressors that are qualitatively different from previously documented physical threat and threat of pain. The findings can provide new leads in understanding possible health benefits stemming from social interactions and deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of attachment. GAMU grant support will provide us with resources needed in order to finalize the research project and present our findings in leading journals in the field.;EN;;Academic

PARP1/2 double knock-out or null PARG mutant mice die at early stages of embryonic development preventing their study in the germ cells, where physiological induction of DNA damage is essential to promote faithful chromosome segregation. Caenorhabditis elegans PARP1/2 and PARG null mutants are viable and fertile, allowing the unprecedented analysis of their roles during meiosis. We have collected strong preliminary observations that uncover a previously unknown role for PARG in stimulating meiotic DNA double strand break (DSB) formation and in promoting their homologous recombination-mediated repair together with BRCA1. By exploiting the powerful genetics, biochemical and cytological tools provided by the C. elegans system, we expect to shed new light on how catabolism of ADP-ribose influences DSB induction/repair dynamics in the germ cells and to identify the targets of PARG-1 in vivo, a type of analysis never carried out up to date.;EN;;Academic

Functional SORLA keeps the levels of Amyloid-β in the brain in a healthy balance regulating APP processing into Amyloid-β, and by binding excess Amyloid-β to target it for lysosomal degradation. In the past two-three years it has become clear that heterozygous, damaging variants in the SORL1 gene are associated with and possibly causative for AD. Furthermore, the load of pathogenic and risk-increasing SORL1 variants in AD patients is large, which suggests that it is imperative to invest in the identification of those at risk to become affected with SORL1-associated AD, and the selective treatment of affected individuals. In this proposal we have created a collaboration of international investigators who are highly capable of answering the open questions regarding SORL1 variant pathogenicity and protein functions. Within this synergy of expertise, we will generate a working-pipeline to assess SORL1 variant pathogenicity, allowing the accurate diagnosis of patients with SORL1-associated AD and we will invest in the identification of selective SORL1-boosting or SORL1-fixing treatments applicable to individuals affected by compromised SORLA function.;EN;;Academic

It is therefore of uttermost importance to study the actual development of the disease and not only the detectable consequences. Curiously, molecular mechanisms underlying the earliest developmental changes of neurons in AD brains are unknown. Here we aim to study this process using in vitro model of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from patients with familial and sporadic AD. Our expertise will allow us to derive and characterize a set of new iPSCs cell lines, differentiate them into self-renewing neural stem cells (NSCs), and to mature neurons and perform mRNA and microRNA Seq analysis.

The project members made initial contact thanks to the Joanna Briggs Collaboration, which is a not-for profit organization and some project partners are members of this collaboration.
The SPIDER project was developed to address the needs of improving skills of European project partners in EBHC, especially in the translation/implementation and utilization of evidence in healthcare clinical practice. The core idea of the project is to support cooperation and exchange of know-how within the unique Evidence-Based Clinical Fellowship Program (EBCFP) context. Based on the current situation, there is not a completely established educational programme which is focused on evidence translation/implementation into practice in Europe. This means that professionals in healthcare across Europe need to improve their experience and skills with implementation of the research evidence into their practice. It is especially important in this era, when praxis in some healthcare fields lags more than 15-years behind science.

Different vertebrates developed distinct ways how to maintain teeth vitality throughout their lives. Unlike them, human teeth have only limited regenerative and reparative capacity and since the average age of human survival is increasing, dentition is more susceptible to variety of diseases which can ultimately lead to teeth loss. Although modern human dental medicine is able to deal with multiple of dental diseases, the treatment is usually limited to application of inorganic artificial compounds beginning with tooth fillings and in the end leading to application of tooth implants or dentures. Currently there is no clinically routinely used method based on utilization of natural biological processes in regenerative dentistry. In this proposal we suggest completely novel approach how to look at the regenerative medicine in general context by performing experiments on the tooth model system via adopting natural developmental mechanisms for controlling highly specific cell differentiation. Our main practical aim is to produce odontoblasts – a dentin-forming cells, which would be naturally able to repair major hard matrix of the tooth. Recently we gathered important data from our single cell RNA-seq datasets (Dental Cell Type Atlas) from the developing teeth which gave us unique information about transcription factor (TF) code activated during odontoblasts differentiation. Adopting this knowledge we propose new approach to prove the role of TF code in odontoblasts differentiation and validate this hypothesis under both in vitro and in vivo conditions during cells-into-tooth transplantations. This approach may open completely new field of dentistry and in long-term scale can significantly prolong human dental fitness keeping our own teeth healthier and more resistant to dental caries.;EN;;Academic

Even though there are methods available to measure the stress resilience, very few tools are available that would make it possible to reliably categorize population based on the stress resilience of its individuals. This can have consequences especially in high stress situations such as combat scenarios, where it is only after the event where we are able to assess the resilience – however, to prevent the adverse outcome of the high-stress stimulus it is necessary to predict stress resilience before the event actually occurs.  Overall, this project focuses on monitoring stress and stress resilience in various scenarios by by established physiological and psychological markers of stress and stress resilience as well as by our novel methodology for stress measurement. Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience.

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the molecular pathology of achondroplasia, and compromises development of treatment for this devastating human condition. 
Our previous work points to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. 
In the proposed research, we will use mathematical modelling and simulations to reconstruct the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation, and to predict their behavior. The in silico simulations will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling. 
Unraveling the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK activation will aid development of novel treatments for achondroplasia.

More specifically, we will investigate the role of FGF2 signalling intensity, myoepithelial cells and mechanical forces in regulation of mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis. To this end, we will develop and use deep-learning-based pipelines for segmentation and tracking of 3D organoids as well as individual cells in data from time-lapse microscopy imaging and a

The innovation of the IMPULS project is to screen patient´s risk “constantly” through smart wearable mobility/motion sensors in order to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers, hence to increase patient safety.
To generate a large impact, we will integrate our developed smart sensor based digital assistance systems in different health care settings (hospitals, nursing homes, retirement homes, etc.) across Europe. 
Although mobility/motion sensors are common in sports and life-style products (watches) and smart devices and hardware solutions are already available and very inexpensive, this technology has not yet been adopted to fit into the needs of nursing care.

The use of these smart wearable sensors allows further specific objectives:

The main activity foresees a residential experience on July 2019 (from the 8th to the 18th), taking place near Lecce (Italy). Here the international group of participants (30 youngsters) will be involved in different activities, developed through non formal methodologies, following the approaches of peer education and learning by doing: role games, videos, case studies, simulation exercises. During the last days, they'll also create a public health awareness campaign.

Whether the same spatially controlled development occurs in mammals remains under debate. Several studies challenge the traditional view of the mammalian oocyte possessing spherical symmetry suggesting pre-determination based on asymmetrical distribution of maternal factors. Here, we propose to address this long-lasting controversy of mammalian oocyte polarity by leveraging the power of the new cutting-edge techniques cryo-qPCR-tomography and Tomo-RNA-Seq, that we have developed to study the intracellular localization of biological molecules in human eggs. The two techniques have proven exceedingly powerful to elucidate global RNA localization gradients in amphibian and fish oocytes. Based on experience with animal models we apply these tools to analyze human eggs using the position of polar bodies as a determinant of the first developmental axis. This topological expression analysis will determine localization profiles of maternal transcripts related to pluripotency and lineage commitment, and also identify new asymmetrically localized maternal factors. Our study will reveal pivotal aspect of human oocyte development and may, in addition to increasing our knowledge about early human development, have profound impact on a variety of micromanipulation procedures used in human embryology and IVF.;EN;;Academic

Disruption of blood and oxygen supply to the brain leads to neuronal death in the ischemic core within minutes. The hypoperfused tissue surrounding the ischemic core, the penumbra, is at high risk for infarction over time but still salvageable. Neuroprotective bridging, sustaining the penumbra until reperfusion, may widen the therapeutic window, make recanalization treatments accessible to more patients and improve overall IS outcomes. 
As ischemic cell death is primarily mediated by hypoxia, increasing oxygen supply to the penumbra seems THE logical approach. In animal models of IS, normobaric hyperoxygenation (NBHO) significantly increased penumbral oxygen pressure and attenuated brain injury when initiated early after onset of ischaemia and vessel occlusion was transient (35 to 50% infarct volume reduction).
The PROOF project now seeks to demonstrate that NBHO (high-flow 100% oxygen at >45 L/min via a non-rebreather mask, or FiO2=1.0 for intubation/ventilation) reduces infarct growth from baseline to 24 hours compared to standard treatment if administered â‰¤3 hours after onset of anterior circulation IS, in patients with proximal vessel occlusion and salvageable tissue at risk. The study is multi-center, adaptive phase-IIb, randomized, open-label with blindedendpoint (PROBE design).
The primary efficacy criterion will be infarct growth from baseline to 24 hours. Secondary endpoints will be NIHSS 24h, categorical shift in the pre-stroke modified Rankin Score, QoL and cognition at day 90. Potential surrogate biomarkers, health economics and societal impacts will be assessed.
If NBHO proves its neuroprotective potential in this selected population, phase-III trials in all IS patients may be undertaken. Considering its low costs and ease of use, NBHO may impact stroke care worldwide.";EN;;Academic

The main aim of the proposed project is to understand the impact of early life adversity (e.g. early life stress) on self-regulation and reward-related behaviours and to identify protective factors that might buffer the individual from developmental disruptions following early exposure to adversity. We hypothesize that (1) early life stress might modulate the development of corticostriatal and corticolimbic circuitry and increase the risk for maladaptive reward-related behavior in young adulthood, and that (2) preventive intervention focused on self-control and regulation of stress might protect high-risk adolescents (e.g. individuals born very preterm). First, we aim to complement longitudinal data from a prenatal birth cohort with a within-subject design neuroimaging data from young adulthood including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), as well as several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks characterizing one’s ability of self-regulation. Subsequently, we aim to develop a preventive intervention that should improve stress regulation and decrease the prevalence of inappropriate impulse-related behaviours and addiction. Applying these interventions in the high-risk adolescents could help preserve reward-related functions in the prefrontal cortex and other reward circuitry. Effectiveness of the preventive intervention will be tested using a randomized controlled trial. This would allow us to assess the intervention-related changes in adolescents’ behaviour and the underlying physiology and brain plasticity.;EN;;Employee

Clinical samples isolated directly from patients contain massive amount of contaminant human DNA. This fact prevents straightforward TPA sequence analyses. This grant application serves to provide funds needed to finish final experiments for project planning to introduce a new culture-independent enrichment method using methyl-directed restriction endonuclease, which selectively binds bacterial DNA in heterogenous samples. Subsequently, next generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing of paralogous and repetitive regions was shown to be able to reconstruct the complete genome sequences of TPA isolated directly from patients without any biases. Moreover, we applied this new technique to the 26 clinical samples and described different genetics of two distinct subgroups of strains causing modern syphilis.  Accumulation of TPA genetic data will help to select candidate loci for development of vaccine against syphilis.

It is a combination of partners from universities, healthcare centres and hospitals, who are focused on EBHC. The project members made initial contact thanks to the Joanna Briggs Collaboration, which is a not-for profit organization and some project partners are members of this collaboration. 
The SPIDER project was developed to address the needs of improving skills of European project partners in EBHC, especially in the translation/implementation and utilization of evidence in healthcare practice. The core idea of the project is to support cooperation and exchange of know-how within the unique Evidence-Based Clinical Fellowship Program (EBCFP) context. Based on the current situation, in Europe there is not a completely established educational programme which is focused on evidence translation/implementation into practice. This means that professionals in healthcare across Europe need to improve their experience and skills with implementation of the research evidence into their practice. It is especially important in this era, when praxis in some healthcare fields lags more than 15-years behind science. 
The coordinator of this project from the Czech Republic is, together with colleagues from Denmark, the only institution who have trainers qualified to deliver the unique EBCFP, which was developed by experts from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia. JBI is a world leader in the field of EBHC, having developed the unique EBCFP.

Our preliminary data point to a complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels to allow for prolonged ERK activation by FGFRs. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, FGFR interactions of their signaling intermediates, mechanisms governing FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR signal.

Studies have shown that some inhaler types only effectively aerosolize 5-30% of the contained drug. The project MediAir focuses on which influencing physiological and mechanical characteristics exist and how they can be controlled to enlarge effectivity of inhalative drug delivery for individual situations. Based on current research, which is mainly based on in-vivo and in-silico models of the respiratory tract and the human respiration process, a considerable amount of provided drug components are not carried along to the intended site of impact within the respiratory tract. This leads to several deficits of this drug delivery method including situation-specific mostly uncomfortable breathing guidelines for the patients, loss of ineffective but valuable material, special considerations and additional components for children and elderly people. The investigative question focuses on the identification of the influencing parameters for effective drug delivery and how they may be tested to increase effectivity – leading to higher degree of comfort for the patients and less necessary drug components for the producing companies. The testing method will include the use of an actively breathing lung simulator xPULM (integrating multiple lung equivalents, for example also porcine lungs). Within the project, this simulator shall be refined from two perspectives. The mechanical setup will be advanced by including an upper airway model and changeable resistances, with focus on the physiological conditions during simulation including various breathing patterns, flow and pressure dependencies, based on analysed and annotated flow data from the included study population. The used aerosol production units will be characterised prior to the measurement cycles for particle analysis and reference measurements.

Despite these inconsistences there is a great deal of innovation in the teaching of spiritual/person centred care that needs to be captured, shared and built upon to
ensure nursing students are equipped to address the holistic needs of the people they care for. This will ensure the nursing workforce of the future is prepared to address some of the global challenges that are impacting upon international nursing and healthcare.

Its role as a crucial tumor suppressor has been well-established, however its contribution to other processes such as embryonal development has only recently been revealed. Interestingly, p53 has been shown to regulate mesoendodermal differentiation via direct activation of the Wnt pathway and indirect influence of Smad signaling molecules. Such unexpected discoveries suggest that p53 might have other important regulatory roles during human embryonic development. This prompted us to utilize the expertise in our laboratory to explore the protein’s behavior during neuroectodermal differentiation in vitro, using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cerebral organoids. Organoids represent a 3D in vitro model which produces structures reminiscent of the human brain, and it has recently been implemented in our laboratory. To study the role of p53, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete p53 from hESCs and induced the cells to form cerebral organoids. Our preliminary finding showed that the absence of p53 strongly enhances the neural development in vitro and generates cerebral organoids with better neuronal morphology and higher expression of neuronal markers. We therefore aim to explore this phenomenon further. Firstly, using molecular techniques such as qPCR, we will quantify the expression of various neural markers, such as Sox2, β-3-tubulin, Doublecortin and others. In parallel, we will describe possible differences between the growth rate and cell cycle mechanics of wild-type and p53KO (knockout) cells. Secondly, we will functionally visualize the electric potential of the neurons within the cerebral organoids. And lastly, we will initiate experiments to identify molecular pathways responsible for the different p53KO phenotype. Collectively, our findings will aid in completing the repertoire of the enigmatic protein’s actions, as well as potentially unveil completely new pathways taking place during human neural development.;EN;;

Methyltransferases catalyze methylation of histones and non-histone proteins, and play  crucial roles in diverse biological processes, including initiation and progression of cancer. DOT1L was found to be critical for leukemogenesis of several mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) subtypes and represents a suitable target for selective killing of leukemia cells. However, we are not aware of any reports on a role of DOT1L in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, DOT1L is expressed in CLL cells (in-house data from expression microarray) which we very recently found to be considerably sensitive to our proprietary C-nucleoside inhibitors.
The proposed project represents an interdisciplinary (in-house chemistry & cell biology plus external structural biology) approach for preclinical optimization of our proprietary, potentially patentable lead compounds, including their thorough in vitro and in vivo characterization. The project capitalizes i.a. on competitive chemistry know-how: our recently published synthetic route is, to our knowledge, the only reasonably flexible technology for preparation of sufficiently diverse carbocyclic C-nucleosides. Utilizing the newly identified sufficiently potent and selective chemical biology probes for DOT1L and other methyltransferases, we aim to decipher the therapeutic potential of targeting these enzymes in the treatment of selected types of leukemia.";EN;;employee, academic

The current body of research supports the concept that protein aggregation initiates the onset of Alzheimer's disease. However, in spite of the large number of available literature and studies, a mechanism of pathogenesis and potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. Here we apply modern and highly specific analytical techniques to relevant in vitro models able to comprehensively capture all important aspects of the human neuropathology. Implementation of such models to study Alzheimer's disease will allow for proper hypothesis testing and will drive important findings. For that reason, general objective of proposed interdisciplinary and interfaculty project is to develop and apply state-of-the-art analytical methodology to a newly introduced cell biology model to study and potentially elucidate hypothetical mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Specifically, we aim to develop modern analytical tools suitable to determine levels of gangliosides and proteins primarily involved in aggregation. Simultaneously, we will establish an adequate in vitro model based on cerebral organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells, suitable to test hypothetical mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Subsequently, we will apply analytical methodology to the conceptual model exploring the influence of gangliosides on the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Finally, we also aim to challenge the in vitro cellular model with an environmental perturbation (e.g. microorganisms) and capture the resulting pathological impacts in relation to Alzheimer’s disease. We believe that proposed combination of analytical technology with disease modeling using stem cells provides a unique opportunity to bring an urgently needed new perspective the field of Alzheimer’s disease research.;EN;;Academic

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the pathology of achondroplasia and other related conditions, and compromises development of treatment for these devastating human conditions. Our previous work at the field, and preliminary experiments carried out for this proposal, point to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. In this proposal, we will use mathematical modelling and simulations to reconstruct, for the first time, the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation and to predict their behavior. The in silico simulations will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important molecular switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling. 
Unraveling the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK activation will facilitate development of novel treatments for achondroplasia and related conditions. Because many other, FGFR3-unrelated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) utilize prolonged ERK activation in their pathological signaling, the theoretic and experimental work proposed here will advance the understanding of general mechanisms of developmental defects, cancer and other disorders caused by aberrant RTK activation.";EN;;Academic

HR repairs DNA damage by copying the correct genetic information from an intact chromosomal template, which is critically dependent on the recombinase RAD51. To ensure its timely and accurate completion, HR is positively and negatively regulated by RAD51 co-factors and antiPage recombinases. How these HR regulators function at the molecular level remains poorly understood and represents a significant challenge to the field due to the lack of mechanistic resolution afforded by conventional bulk biochemical approaches. We recently pioneered several cutting-edge biophysical approaches to interrogate the HR reaction in unprecedented detail.
Importantly, we demonstrated the power of integrating data from these complementary methodologies to uncover the mechanism of action of the Rad51 paralogs in modulating RAD51 to promote HR. The aim of our proposal is to extend this paradigm to study multiple different HR regulators to gain insights into how they work individually and how they act cooperatively during HR. Deciphering how HR regulators work will provide an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms relevant to carcinogenesis and may present unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention.";EN;;Academic

The objective of oncogenetics is to understand genetic predisposition to cancers and care for persons at risk. Genetic predispositions are often associated with a family history of cancer. However, cancers are very frequent and family histories exist, so a family history of cancer is not synonymous with a genetic predisposition. The purpose of a genetic consultation is to determine the share of family history and possible predisposition. Genetic tests, stills seldom practiced, sometimes confirm a hereditary origin. If an alteration is identified in a family, it can be sought in its relations. This makes it possible to reassure those having no predisposition and following up those at risk.;EN;;Academic

They usually have a rapid and aggressive course and affect not only the patient's life but also the life of those around him. The most important goal of care for these individuals is therefore to cure the disease completely (if possible) or at least to achieve a long-term remission so that the patient can return to normal life. It is therefore necessary not only to recognise the disease early, but also to diagnose it accurately and administer high-quality therapy. A great promise is the introduction of so-called personalised medicine, which allows the patient to tailor treatment to his or her needs, including minimising side effects, while comprehensively assessing the various factors influencing the effect of the therapy in question. Infectious complications are very often part of the treatment - they are even a more common cause of death than the disease itself.

These disorders affect more than 5% of the human population worldwide. Psychiatric illnesses represent a significant and growing socio-economic burden on European populations. Although the development of psychopharmaceuticals has led to significant improvements in the treatment of the most severe disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and major depressive disorder, the effectiveness of treatment is limited. The initiative for bilateral collaboration between Czech and Norwegian scientists brings together the teams of Assoc. Wadeley, as project proponent, and Prof. Glover, as project partner. The scientific team of doc. Wadeley is interested in finding out what causes the devastating psychological states in schizophrenia. Her team has generated neurons from specific patients suffering from schizophrenia using state-of-the-art technology called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Neurons are key brain cells that trigger our thinking and behaviour. The next step in the project is to understand why neurons behave abnormally in schizophrenic patients. Prof Glover's research team has expertise in how neurons communicate with each other at the molecular and cellular level. They also have expertise in stem cell culture. Our proposed bilateral project aims to develop a comprehensive platform of complementary techniques to assess communication between neural circuits and neurons derived from induced stem cells in schizophrenic patients. The outcomes of the bilateral initiative are as follows: 3 phd students and 1-2 junior postdoc scientists will be involved in the bilateral training required to: 1) set up and use the neuron-to-neuron communication platform; 2) gain the practical knowledge required to apply neurodifferentiation protocols; 3) directly compare the different platforms in terms of advantages for speed, throughput, drug compatibility, and potential for cross-application; and 4) transfer knowledge, share experiences, skills, and best practices.";EN;;Academic

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this phenomenon remain poorly characterized. An absence of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK signaling complicates understanding of the pathology of achondroplasia and other related conditions, and compromises development of a treatment for these debilitating human diseases.;EN;;Academic

These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing active FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. In this proposal, we will use mathematical modeling to reconstruct, for the first time, the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation and to predict their behavior. The in silico simulations of FGFR3 signal transduction processes will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important molecular switches and regulators.

Attractive as this concept is, its implementation is conditioned by many facts that go beyond biology. Of particular importance are the following two: a) the availability of non-cellular carrier materials that will support normal cell behaviour, in particular cell division, differentiation and 3D organisation into typical morphological structures; b) the demonstration that tissue engineering is an approach that has the potential to be scalable in terms of economic cost and effect on human (societal) health. This project builds on the unique expertise existing at five MU departments, which gives the opportunity to adequately study and develop the above aspects of tissue engineering. The first aspect, carrier development, will use a combination of polymer wetting and 3D deposition and their plasmochemical modification with functional groups, followed by iterative comprehensive testing of their properties in in vitro systems with cells. An important feature will be that the cells used will be normal human stem and progenitor cells with relevant clinical potential. The second aspect, socio-economic calculation, will use information on the cost of research, development and implementation of possible tissue engineering-based medical and biotechnological approaches. The estimated effects of the results achieved will serve as input for the elaboration of model-based economic cost-effectiveness analyses. The experience gained will result in the formulation of methodological recommendations for refining the methodology of cost-effectiveness assessment in the field of tissue engineering.

In experimental laboratory rat models, it has been found that Paclitaxel administration triggers an inflammatory response in the spinal ganglia, spinal cord and other structures of the central nervous system. Similar changes also occur in chronic nerve injury characterized by induction of satellite glial cell activation, invasion of activated macrophages, microglia proliferation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. The spread of the inflammatory reaction to the various stages of the central nervous system may be via the blood and/or the liquor. Our earlier experiments demonstrated the penetration of labeled dextran from blood and liquor into the spinal ganglion, demonstrating the permeability of the blood-nerve and liquor-nerve barriers to cytokine-sized molecules. We also found that peripheral nerve injury induces cellular changes and increased HLB permeability in the plexus choroideus (CP) of the cerebral ventricles.  ;EN;;Academic

In previous years, extensive research was conducted on the process of assessing non-healing wounds in clinical practice (in acute inpatient care, home care and social service settings).   Based on the analysis of the outcomes of previous projects, gaps were identified not only in the assessment of non-healing wounds, but in particular in the lack of erudition of non-medical direct care workers in wound management and in identifying the risk of decubitus lesions. The quality of care for people with non-healing wounds has been assessed within the framework of JRC projects, but the issue of assessing the psychometric properties of assessment tools has not yet been addressed in the Czech Republic. This paper is thus one of the first of its kind. The project should enable further improvement of the quality of care using foreign experience (especially the work of Prof. M. Ahtial from Finland and the validation of the scale for assessing the risk of decubitus) and their implementation. Particular attention will be paid to the identification of patients at risk of developing decubitus in intensive care and to the assessment of inter-rater reliability of individual tools. This is an intervention project. The project activities build on the professional activities of the project co-proposer (member of the committee of the Czech Society for Wound Management - CSWM, member of the committee of the European Wound Management Association - EWMA) and contacts with the Finnish researcher Prof. Maarit Ahtiala. The aim of the project is to improve the professional competences of general nurses in wound management in intensive care. The project is designed as a multidimensional one, linking specific areas of wound management - prevention and diagnosis of pressure ulcers. It also changes the perspective on the identification of lesion risk. The basis of the process of effective care is the correct determination of risk, followed by diagnosis and appropriate treatment - naming and epidemiological assessment of the phenomenon. Based on the project activities, it will be possible to collect relevant data, to perform clinical and population (epidemiological) assessment in a specific health care facility, to plan and implement educational activities for health care professionals in direct care and to increase the knowledge and skills of health care professionals.;EN;;Academic

For better illustration, the molecule FGF21 has been selected, which is a protein with high potential in health care and therapy of selected diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and related cardiovascular diseases). However, an important limitation for the practical use of FGF21 is its extremely low stability and relatively high cost of production. As it is a relatively new protein whose properties have been described relatively recently, no clear idea has yet been established about the future route of administration to patients. The task of the ESF and LF investigators will be to map the needs of the target markets and the interest of potential consumers in terms of final administration. This information will help the FF to better plan research in the areas of stabilisation, production, and possibly immobilisation, so as to achieve modification of the molecule in line with the end use in practice. The CTT will provide the research team with effective legal and other support towards industrial-law (or other required) protection. This will mitigate the risk of dead-end development branches and will allow the FP to develop a stable FGF21 molecule tailored directly to the needs and purposes mentioned. Work on patent protection will be initiated in due course, eliminating the risk of leakage of confidential information. As a result, the potential for transfer of the researched and innovated product into practice will be greatly enhanced. The concept proposed during the project will be as universal as possible, i.e. applicable to different types of applied research projects. This will ensure that the funds spent on applied research will be used efficiently and directly in relation to what the market and consumer demand.

This complex is involved in the repair of damaged DNA within the nucleotide excision repair pathway, repair of interstrand junctions (caused e.g. by cisplatin treatment) and repair of double-strand breaks (caused e.g. by irradiation) in DNA by homologous recombination. Defects in individual proteins of this complex are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne (CS) syndromes. XPF/ERCC1 has been described to be required for the repair of a number of therapeutic agents including cisplatin. As a consequence, high levels of this complex have been associated with a poor prognosis of response to chemotherapeutic treatment in a number of cancers (e.g., ovarian cancer, non-small cell carcinoma, melanoma), thus predisposing inhibitors of this nuclease to clinical applications. Finally, it has also been described that inhibition of XPF/ERCC1 leads to specific synthetic lethality along with inhibition of ATR and PARP. This principle represents a revolutionary and unique pharmacological target for genetically defined tumor types.;EN;;Academic

By appropriate inhibition or activation of these proteins by drugs, pathological processes could be inhibited or desired processes could be promoted. However, the development of such drugs is very costly because the investigational substance must pass through all phases of laboratory and clinical testing to determine its pharmacokinetics, toxicity and specificity. However, it is rarely possible to develop a specific, non-toxic inhibitor of a given mutant form of a particular kinase. Thus, there are many chemicals that have not proven to be specific inhibitors of a particular kinase, and for which much money has already been invested in their development. and other drugs whose development has been halted at various stages because, of the entire family of tyrosine kinases, the drug needs to target only one particular enzyme or only one mutant form of that enzyme. Because RTK signaling is involved in controlling cell proliferation and migration, mutations in RTKs often manifest themselves in the development of cancerous tumors. Testing the specificity of a therapeutic under development is a key step in its development, verifying the effect of a given chemical on the activity of the targeted kinase as well as on the activity of related enzymes in different cell types. Our laboratory has developed a plasmid library of 331 RTK receptors and their mutants that have been associated with more than 50 human diseases. This set in its breadth represents a globally unique set of all receptor kinases on which the specificity of potential therapeutics can be tested. We have also developed a luciferase reporter to read out the activity of one RTK signaling pathway, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway. Since almost all RTKs signal in the same way, it is likely that this reporter will detect the activity of other RTKs as well. The aim of the project is to modify the existing FGF reporter to be able to read the activity of all RTK receptors and to introduce specificity testing of RTK inhibitors using the reporter and the RTK library.;EN;;Academic

However, as in other fields of medicine, a new paradigm of personalised medicine is gaining significant traction in rare diseases, where personalisation is defined as the use of both disease-specific and patient-specific characteristics. The range of applications of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) is expanding at a tremendous pace. The introduction of ATMPs into orphan disease therapies appears to be a very innovative and promising approach that needs to be validated in a clinical trial setting. Using the principles of personalised medicine, ATMPs, especially monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors, are used in the treatment of paediatric cancer patients. Childhood cancers can also be seen as rare diseases. However, ATMPs are only registered for the adult patient population and are thus used off-label in paediatric oncology. There is very little clinical evidence of dose correlation, therapeutic concentration or anti-tumour effect of these treatments in children. There is a complete lack of information on the issue of adverse effects of these drugs in paediatric cancer patients.

Surgical treatment is the only potentially curative treatment with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%. Less than 10% of patients with synchronous JMCC undergo liver resection. The traditional treatment approach (primary first approach) is to remove the primary tumour in the first instance and resect the metastases after systemic treatment. The disadvantage is the time delay from the diagnosis of JMCC to their resection. An initially resectable lesion may become unresectable. Simultaneous resection of the primary tumor and liver metastases is burdened with higher perioperative mortality. In the last decade, another approach has emerged with the intention of increasing the resectability of JMCC - liver first approach (LFA). In this case, neoadjuvant systemic therapy is followed by liver resection. This is followed by adjuvant systemic therapy and finally resection of the primary tumour.

Acute intestinal ischemia (acute mesenteric ischemia - AMI) is one of the most serious. The reported incidence of AMI after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) resection is 3% for elective and up to 60% for emergent procedures, with a mortality rate of up to 90%. Early detection of AMI is absolutely essential to initiate treatment while the condition is still reversible. Clinical diagnosis of AMI is very difficult, and there is no specific laboratory marker. Diagnostic imaging methods are limited by sensitivity and specificity. Angiography and colonoscopy are invasive, limited in availability and not always feasible. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and microRNA are new technologies potentially suitable for early diagnosis of AMI.

These tumours are often pseudohypoxic and may therefore exhibit a number of changes in cellular homeostasis and metabolism. It is known that hypoxia modulates calcium transport and also that Ca2+ signaling pathways are remodeled or deregulated in tumors, and these changes in cellular physiology distinguish them from non-tumor tissue. This remodeling or deregulation of Ca2+ signaling pathways may represent a mechanism by which cancer cells resist systemic anti-tumor defense mechanisms. Thus, the aim of this project is to study changes in gene expression of Ca2+ transport systems in clear cell carcinoma samples compared to healthy kidney tissue. The physiological/pathophysiological consequences of these changes will be studied in vitro in RCC4 and CAKI1 stable cell lines, both derived from clear cell renal cell carcinoma.;EN;;Academic

Imatinib, a selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, represents the first-line treatment for most patients. The second-line drugs are the much more effective higher-generation TKi (dasatinib and nilotinib, or ponatinib). Especially nilotinib, but also imatinib, show adverse vascular toxic effects. The aim of this project is to define the factors associated with vascular toxicity of the TKi imatinib and nilotinib in in vitro and in vivo experiments in order to determine the ability of TKi to induce endothelial dysfunction and the mechanism of its occurrence (contribution of NO, reactive oxygen species, ER stress and autophagy/apoptosis) by a comprehensive approach.

A large proportion of women exhibiting certain clinical signs of preterm birth will, however, eventually deliver in term, while only a smaller proportion of pregnant women (mainly those with premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM)) inevitably delivers in a short time after first clinical presentation (< 7 days). Currently, no biomarkers are available to distinguish between women who will deliver < 7 days after clinical presentation/hospital admission for PTB and those who will deliver later. Adipokines are a family of proteins predominantly secreted by adipose tissue that play an important role in physiology as well as pathophysiology of pregnancy. Specific expression profiles in context of the genetic background as well as metabolic profiles thus may provide potential biomarkers of PTB.

One of the most common factors that lead to HF is heterogeneous structural changes in heart tissue caused by myocardial ischemia or other cardiac disease, which result in so called dyssynchrony between right and left ventriclesor between particular parts of left ventricle. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is a powerful tool for improving the symptoms and reducing mortality in patients with HF. Depending on the character and severity of heart electromechanical abnormality, different treatment techniques can be applied, one of them is electrical stimulation. However, some limitations of electrical pacing cannot be removed because of principle of the approach itself. Alternative stimulation techniques based on UV or visible light illumination in combination with genetic modification of the tissue (so called optogenetics), high-intensity ultrasound pulses, and infra-red laser illumination have been examined under experimental conditions and most recently in human in case of ultrasound-based CRT. In contrast to the electrical pacing, the optical approaches would provide some important benefits such as: high precision of stimuli localization and, hence, more physiological pacing and reduction of the affecting the nearby tissue, absence of pacing artefact in ECG which is important for performing of analysis of QRS complexes or ST segments and, finally, possible recording of the heart electrical activity in close proximity to stimulated area which would be useful for improvement of today's and development of new diagnostic, treatment, or surgical techniques.;EN;;Academic

Recent studies revealed increased expression of various H2S producing enzymes in various cancer cell types, which points to a new role of H2S in the pathophysiology of cancer. However, exogenous H2S plays important and specific roles in many physiological and pathological activities as well. Its effect is dose dependent. At low concentrations, H2S shows cytoprotective effects while at high concentrations H2S has cytotoxic effects, such as stimulating apoptosis and cell death. Slow sulfide donor GYY4137 significantly induced death in some cancer cells by decreasing glycolysis and lactate overproduction. Thus, GYY4137 administration can be considered a novel and selective anti-cancer strategy.

To protect the genome, hPSCs have increased base excision DNA repair (BER) and homologous recombination (HR) activity, while the activity of non-homologous DNA end joining and microhomology-based alternative splicing (MMEJ) remains constant. Our hypothesis proposes that clusters of oxidative damage to DNA bases are converted via BER into double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are further repaired error-free by rapid MMEJ, while pluripotency-controlling proteins cooperate to protect DNA ends from HR and NHEJ. Adapted hPSCs, also use this combination of pathways to repair DSBs induced by increased replicative stress. The result is misrepair and increased mutation frequency of hPSCs. The aim of this project is to test this hypothesis and to show that chemical redirection of double-strand break repair from MMEJ to HR in adapted hPSCs can reduce mutation frequency, allowing longer and more efficient cultivation of pluripotent stem cells.;EN;;Academic

We expect that the role of the hydrogen pick-up, as observed recently for NiTi-based alloys, is generic and may affect the ion release rate also in other types of metallic materials. Moreover, data on combined effects related to ion released kinetics from more than one metallic part are completely missing. A crucial factor to investigate with respect to a save alloy performance after multiple implantations is the link between the ion release rates from the individual alloys and the reactions of the living tissues. Therefore, a special attention will be paid to a cellular protein and miRNA production in relation to the metal ion release.;EN;;Academic

Because each cell responds to many different stimuli simultaneously, there must be specific intracellular mechanisms of RTK signaling that allow cells to respond precisely to their environment. Detailed characterization of these mechanisms is one of the major challenges of modern biology. Recent findings demonstrate that unrelated RTKs can interact and activate (transactivate) each other. Although these unusual RTK interactions play an important role in the mechanisms of RTK function in the organism, they remain the least understood area of RTK signaling to date. The aim of the proposed project is to identify most of the existing transactivations between human RTKs. We will then define the molecular mechanisms of RTK transactivations and determine the functional consequences of transactivations for RTK signaling in cells. Characterization of RTK transactivations will deepen the fundamental understanding of RTK function and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of tumors caused by pathological RTK signaling.;EN;;Academic

Pathological activation of FGFR leads to more than 20 diseases such as growth disorders, metabolic syndromes and tumors. Sustained activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway is known to be a major mediator of FGFR function in the cell, although the mechanism of this phenomenon is still unclear. Our preliminary experiments point to complex protein regulatory networks that function at multiple levels and enable sustained activation of the ERK pathway by FGFR. These include mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, FGFR interaction with members of their signaling complexes, mechanisms regulating FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in FGFR inhibition. The goal of this project is to describe the mechanisms enabling sustained activation of the ERK pathway in the major FGFR-regulated processes in the organism. Elucidating the mechanisms regulating FGFR-ERK signalling is key to understanding the underlying processes of FGFR function and will help identify new therapeutic approaches to treat diseases caused by FGFR deregulation.;EN;;Academic

While the events associated with the UPR have been studied in detail by us in ovarian malignancies, their role in the regeneration and senescence of the normal OSE has not been satisfactorily described. In this project, we will 1) monitor UPR activity in normal OSE in a temporospatial and histopathological context, 2) study the interactions between UPR, senescence, and OSE tissue plasticity, and 3) use a model of OSE as a variable, non-malignant epithelium to study the role of novel ER regulators in epithelial plasticity.

By appropriate inhibition or activation of these proteins by drugs, pathological processes could be inhibited or desired processes could be promoted. However, the development of such drugs is very costly, because from the whole family of tyrosine kinases, the drug needs to target only one specific enzyme or only one mutant form of it. Because RTK signaling is involved in controlling cell proliferation and migration, mutations in RTKs often manifest themselves in the development of cancerous tumors. Testing the specificity of a therapeutic under development is a key step in its development, verifying the effect of a given chemical on the activity of the targeted kinase as well as on the activity of related enzymes in different cell types. Our laboratory has developed a plasmid library of 331 RTK receptors and their mutants that have been associated with more than 50 human diseases. This set in its breadth represents a globally unique set of all receptor kinases on which the specificity of potential therapeutics can be tested. We have also developed a luciferase reporter to read out the activity of one RTK signaling pathway, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway. Since almost all RTKs signal in the same way, it is likely that this reporter will detect the activity of other RTKs as well. The aim of the project is to modify the existing FGF reporter to be able to read the activity of all RTK receptors and to introduce specificity testing of RTK inhibitors using the reporter and the RTK library.;EN;;Academic

Rigorous quality control of cell technologies is essential for safety, efficacy or product quality. This includes, in particular, (a) checking cell identity (avoiding contamination with similar cell types), (b) minimising changes in genotype (karyotype) and phenotype in culture (e.g. loss of pluripotency) or (c) testing the stability of the cell product (batch-to-batch variability). Due to the rapid development of technologies that have until recently been limited to experimental use, the procedures for quality verification of cell-based technologies are not yet well defined by regulatory authorities (e.g. the State Institute for Drug Control). Quality control is usually based only on karyotyping, identification of hypervariable genomic segments or analysis of a few specific markers that do not reveal e.g. global phenotypic shifts. In recent years, we have developed a method combining mass spectrometry of intact cells (Intact Cell MALDI-TOF MS) and analysis of specific spectral patterns and their discrimination using advanced mathematical methods (e.g. artificial intelligence - artificial neural networks and non-linear analysis). The principle of the method is the assumption that any change that occurs in the cells will be reflected in a spectral pattern that we are able to record, recognize and evaluate based on a reference database. This method is a unique methodological approach with the necessary sensitivity and high quantitative discrimination capability in human cells and is capable of implementation in various applications using cellular technologies.;EN;;Academic

Deregulation in its uptake and transport at the level of the organism and individual tissues and cells is associated with the existence of a number of pathological conditions. Breast cancer tumour tissue contains significantly increased concentrations of zinc ions compared to normal tissue. This phenomenon is associated with deregulation of the expression/activity of proteins that control its transport and homeostasis. Literature data and our preliminary results show that increased intracellular Zn concentration affects the aggressiveness of cancer cells and their sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our preliminary results also suggest the involvement of Zn transporters ZIP4 and ZIP13 in the process of metastatic dissemination. The aim of this present project is to assess the importance of the adaptive processes of breast cancer cells to elevated Zn ion concentrations in the regulation of their growth, metastatic activity and chemosensitivity and to evaluate the importance of ZIP4 and ZIP13 transporters in these processes.  To achieve these goals, an interdisciplinary team was formed including expertise in molecular biology, tissue culture, imaging methods, in vivo breast cancer models, and chemical analysis of Zn ion distribution in tumor tissues.

In this project, we plan to study the human microbiome in primary antibody immune deficiencies, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and selective IgA deficiency (IgAD). In both diseases, IgA production is seriously affected. Since IgA is the dominant mucosal immunoglobulin and plays a central role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, it is expected that i) the gut microbiome reflects changes in host mucosal immune system. In addition, since there is a significant portion of patients without clinical symptoms or with very mild symptoms, it is likely that ii) the microbiome composition is of importance in these inapparent disease cases. To determine microbiome composition, 16S rRNA gene sequences from the gut microbiome will be examined in all DNA samples (n =50) isolated from patients and healthy controls. In addition, analysis of gut metagenome by whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing and subsequent analysis of gut metabolome will be performed in 6-10 samples previously characterized by the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. This will allow characterization of microbial communities present in the samples and determination of alpha and beta diversity of the samples. In addition, functional characterization of human microbiome will be performed together with determination of the host's metabolome in a number of selected samples.;EN;;

There is a unique combination of departments at Masaryk University that have relevant know-how, but since their research was developed and is being developed independently, there is a need to strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration between them. The Centre for Biomedical Image Analysis of the Faculty of Informatics has extensive experience in two main parts of the present project. The first is the preparation, cultivation and subsequent differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which nowadays occupy one of the primary source cultures for the controlled repair of human tissues and organs. The second area is the automated analysis of biomedical images, including the development and implementation of new algorithms in functional software. The Department of Physical Electronics of the Faculty of Science and the Centre for Advanced Nanotechnologies and Microtechnologies (CEITEC) are among the major centres addressing the development of new types of nanoparticles with different physicochemical properties. The Department of Histology and Embryology of the Faculty of Medicine has unique experience in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at a scale that allows to gain new insights into the interaction of nanoparticles at the level of cellular nanostructures. The aim of the project is to determine the biological properties (short- and long-term toxicity) of different types of coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, then to describe their interactions at the level of cellular nanostructures and to develop a software tool that will allow real-time and spatial (4D) tracking of nanoparticles as they penetrate cell cultures in fluidized systems with varying magnetic field strengths. The project will result in clearly described biological characteristics of new types of nanoparticles prepared by a unique plasmochemical synthesis method and a software tool to track their utilization. The expected biological findings should be relevant for applications in tissue engineering, where magnetic nanoparticles in association with magnetic fields are an important tool for the guidance and homing of these cells into damaged tissues, where they induce tissue repair.;EN;;Academic

The previous project resulted in the implementation of behavioural paradigms for testing psychological functions and their disorders. Specifically, four tests of different aspects of impulsivity, a paradigm for testing emotion regulation strategies and their effectiveness, and a social cognition test distinguishing between affective and cognitive theories of mind were implemented. Behavioral tests can be used in conjunction with psychophysiological and neuroimaging methods to map the physiological and neural correlates of given mental functions that manifest during test performance, and finally to select targeted treatments, e.g., using rTMS. The parameters of the tests have been developed according to existing research results and adapted for use in the Czech population. The tests are original, therefore the first goal of the follow-up project is a detailed analysis of the performance of the healthy population, which is essential for understanding healthy test performance strategies and for the subsequent interpretation of results in patients with mental disorders. At the same time, the paradigms need to be tested first without neuroimaging methods that create a specific test situation. The second goal is to pilot the behavioral paradigms already with psychophysiological and neuroimaging methods in a healthy population. The third goal is to initiate full testing, i.e., behavioral paradigms in conjunction with psychophysiological and neuroimaging methods, in patients with mental disorders, specifically testing impulsivity in patients with borderline personality disorder, ADHD, and Parkinson's disease, testing emotion regulation in patients with eating disorders, and testing social cognition in patients with schizophrenia.

In experimental laboratory rat models, it has been shown that after intravenous administration of paclitaxel, pharmacologically induced peripheral neuropathy occurs, manifested by the triggering of an inflammatory response in the spinal ganglia, spinal cord and other structures of the central nervous system. Similar changes occur with chronic nerve injury, which also induces activation of satellite glial cells, invasion of activated macrophages, proliferation of microglia and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. The spread of the inflammatory response to the various stages of the central nervous system may be via the blood and/or the liquor. Our earlier experiments demonstrated the penetration of labeled dextran from blood and liquor into the spinal ganglion, demonstrating the permeability of the blood-nerve and liquor-nerve barriers to cytokine-sized molecules. We also found that peripheral nerve injury induces cellular changes and increased permeability of the blood-liquor barrier.  ;EN;;Academic

Ph.D.;233399;Implemented by;01.01.2016;31.12.2018;Recipient;GA ČR / Junior Grants;LF;Department of Histology and Embryology;Double-strand breaks represent some of the most toxic DNA damage. Homologous recombination (HR) is the mechanism responsible for their precise repair. HR prevents the rise of genomic instability associated with the development of tumorigenesis, but increased expression of recombination factors leads to resistance to anticancer therapy. Key proteins involved in HR include RAD51 recombinase, BRCA2 recombination mediator and RAD51 paralogs. Congenital mutations in these genes are associated with a predisposition to the development of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers and with the insidious inherited disease Fanconi anaemia (FA), characterized by short stature, changes in skin pigmentation, haematological abnormalities and increased risk of tumours. Despite all this, the exact molecular mechanism of action of the aforementioned proteins remains to be fully elucidated. In this project, we focus on the functional characterization of tumor mutations of the RAD51 protein. By studying fast reaction kinetics using the stopped-flow method, we have so far demonstrated the importance of the regulation of RAD51 presynaptic filament activity and conformation by the action of RAD51 paralogs. The next step is to isolate clinically relevant RAD51 mutants and determine their influence on the properties of the generated presynaptic filaments. The results obtained may contribute not only to the understanding of the molecular basis of FA and tumorigenesis, but also potentially to the development of new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of radio- and chemoresistant tumors.;EN;;Academic

One of the biggest obstacles in production of pluripotent stem cells is adaptation of the cells to the culture conditions in vitro, accompanied by genome destabilization. Genome stability is also critical to the quality of germ cells. To protect the genomic stability, pluripotent cells as well as germ cells pose elevated BER and homologous recombination, while NHEJ remains constant. Such unique DNA repair setup can be found only in pluripotent stem cells and germ cells. While pluripotent stem cells dowregulate BER during prolonged cultivation similar decrease in BER was observed in male germ cells during ageing. The aim of the project is to verify the hypothesis that the pathway choice in BER rich pluripotent stem cells and germ cells affecting output error rate depends on the channeling of the base damage through BER mediated double stranded breaks to NHEJ, while the pluripotency controlling proteins cooperate on shielding the DNA ends from HR. Simultaneously we want to uncover pathways regulating the activity of BER related to ageing of germ cells and adaptation process in pluripotent stem cells.;EN;;Academic

They are of high and increasing prevalence in EU countries. These co-morbidities are leading causes of further health decline and premature mortality, posing challenges for appropriate and effective healthcare and resources. Current treatments are unable to halt the disease epidemics and to prevent their late consequences. Identification and targeting new metabolic pathways and other metabolic abnormalities seem likely to yield improved therapy, particularly in a personalized approach. The aim of this project is to investigate how abnormal high levels of the reactive metabolite methylglyoxal (a principal marker of “dicarbonyl stress”) in obesity, diabetes and renal failure contributes to common mechanisms driving development of metabolic and vascular co-morbidities and exploit this for improved patient care. We will characterise the role of dicarbonyl stress in the co-morbidities and evaluate, at proof of concept stage, novel nutritional medicine treatments. The objectives are:
1. To develop experimental evidence in preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the pathophysiological role of dicarbonyl stress in metabolic and vascular co-morbidities of obesity, diabetes and renal insufficiency.
2. To personalize treatment and care by developing biomarkers to stratify the patient population by severity of dicarbonyl stress.
3. To evaluate treatments for dicarbonyl stress to halt and alleviate co-morbidities. The primary clinical intervention evaluated is a dietary bioactive formulation (nutritional medicine) that increases expression of glyoxalase 1 - the enzyme that detoxifies methylglyoxal.
4. To expand the skills base and share best practise in dicarbonyl stress research.
5. To secure related technical and medical innovation for the EU.

The project aims at the development of an interdisciplinary platform for comprehensive research of body-brain-mind interactions to provide the synergy of tools, approaches and intellectual capacity. We will test the hypothesis that reduced integration abilities manifested on many levels of brain organization (from neurons to brain networks) are reflected in the impaired integration of mind - we will specifically test it by analysis of the ability to  integrate the information about the body in the mind, to integrate borders of bodily self, and to integrate novel information into context during psychotherapy. To achieve this we will use schizophrenia as a model that exhibits a reduction in  integration abilities. The major progress beyond the state of the art is the analysis of neural networks using computational tools, cellular pathophenotypic profiling using patient-specific glutamatergic neurons, advanced neuroimaging analyses of neuronal networks and connectivity with virtual reality simulations to provide ecological validity of behavioral paradigms, and novel approaches of the research of psychotherapy.

In diagnosis of CF, quantitative analysis of sweat chloride levels is widely accepted, but this procedure is flawed by lengthy and uncomfortable sampling procedure (application of the electric current on skin (iontophoresis)) causing discomfort, pain, itching, redness, skin burns and other symptoms, further by high incidence of false positive and/or false negative results from only chloride analysis and difficulty to set proper diagnostic chloride values, especially in newborn and children screening.The proposed project will be focused at solution of the difficulties which are described in the previous paragraph. The main task is development of novel, fast, non-invasive method for sampling of sweat samples, with particular target for optimization in newborn and pediatric screening. The preliminary results show that a new, proposed  sampling skin wipe method is simple, fast (<10s) and painless. The collected sample can be analyzed by capillary electrophoresis with contactless conductivity detection and double-opposite-end injection approach, allowing simultaneous determination of positively and negatively charged ions. This is of high importance, because it was found that the ionic content of both anions and cations is tightly connected with the ion transfer mechanisms and there were significant changes observed between the group of healthy and CF patients. The project output will have a high significance for the diagnosis of CF, especially to the newborn and pediatric patients, for which the conventional method is inconvenient. An added benefit will also be a higher discriminatory power by using multiparametric data analysis. We assume that the use of multiple ions and appropriate statistical methods will eliminate majority of the false positive and false negative results and will also more accurately pinpoint CF cases in peadiatric patients, especially in the border cases.

Schizophrenia is a condition with altered brain morphology, connectivity, and function. This disorder has no cure and is the most frequent cause of morbidity, disability, and impairment of individual quality of life and well-being. Substantial progress has been made in the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. However, modern antipsychotic medication is still associated with side effects, poor compliance, drug discontinuation, and low efficacy on negative and cognitive symptoms. The inaccessibility of brain cells to evaluate the cellular neuropathology and its changes in the context of clinical or treatment data of living patients is a major obstacle in understanding disease development and the progress of effective treatment. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology renders a breakthrough to convert skin cells, or other cell types, into brain cells (e.g., neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), whereby patient-specific brain cells can be structured in a 2D or a 3D system that mimics neural networks in the brain. This project is to employ iPSC technology with multifaceted approaches, which include biology (consisting of stem cell biology, neurobiology, genetics, and epigenetics), medicine, mathematics, and computational systems to establish a therapeutic platform for individual patients. The platform amalgams an in-vitro iPSC-based schizophrenic model system with in-vivo approaches (MRI imaging, EEG, and behavioural observations) to delineate the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the actions of antipsychotic drugs at multiple levels from molecule, cell, brain, to behaviour.

They include not only cellular based malfunction, most often ion mishandling or organelle defects, such as channelopathies or mitochondrial diseases, but also whole organ impairment such as sinus node diseases. Many of these defects can be corrected to certain degree by symptomatic treatment. However the molecular basis of arrhythmias remains to be treated by future cell replacement therapies. Conventional anti-bradyarrhythmic strategies such as implantation of electronic pacemakers must deal with potential infections, limited battery life and invasive implantation of leads. Although there have been technical improvements, these strategies still lack neurohumoral reactivity. The aim of the present research project is to exploit recent advances in stem cell research and genetic engineering, to develop patient specific cell based strategies in order to fabricate a “biopacemaker” that overcomes the drawbacks of an artificial machine. Channelopathies leading to either arrhythmias or other heart defects will be modelled in vitro using patient specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to uncover the molecular basis of the disease phenotype and to screen for novel drugs. Human fibroblasts and iPSC overexpressing specific channels (e.g. RyR, HCN, KCN, SERCA families etc) either wild type or harbouring patient specific mutations will serve as both the tool to investigate the diseased phenotype and as a “biopacemaker” (BPM) both in vitro and in vivo.

However, roughly 25% of these patients will progress to multiple myeloma (MM) at which time the disease may already have severe clinical consequences. Although several primarily effective therapeutic options are available the disease remains incurable and fatal. Furthermore, clinicians lack personalised diagnostic tools that can serve as a rational basis for a selection of those therapeutics which are most likely to work in a given patient at a given time. 
The concept behind this proposal is that MM growth and survival depend on cell autonomous mechanisms (= oncogenic driver mutations) and non-cell autonomous mechanisms (signals from the tumour microenvironment). These tumour promoting mechanisms (TPMs) are essential for the tumour cell fate and thus it is imperative to first identify and then to target all of them in order to break the resilience of MM cells to therapy and pave the way for disease eradication.
Consequently, the INDICANT consortium (lat. indicare = show the way) aims to establish an integrative diagnostic platform for the identification and validation of all patient specific and druggable TPMs, thereby enabling clinicians to select targeted therapeutic choices for MM patients specifically tailored to their individual TPM-profile. A concise health technology assessment will be part of the developmental program of this innovative diagnostic platform.
Since the envisaged diagnostic platform is applicable to other areas of oncology as well, the project results will open new markets for SMEs and industrial partners in the diagnostics sector and further push the development of products and services for personalised medicine.";EN;;Academic

Thus, finding ways to enhancing motor skill learning capacity in Parkinson’s is essential. Past research indicates that sensory stimulation and task cueing can improve motor learning. Yet, the extent to which increasing individual’s engagement in the task, in addition to sensory stimulation, can have further positive effects remains unknown. This innovation grant aims to demonstrate that increased task engagement through ecological goals and social interaction can significantly improve procedural learning capacity in people with Parkinson’s. To this end, performance in a classical implicit motor learning paradigm (goal: reacting to stimuli presented on a computer screen) will be contrasted with that of two other conditions, where a console videogame (similar to Guitar Hero) will be used, with or without social interaction, in a controlled experiment involving people with Parkinson’s and age and gender-matched controls. The ecological goals in the videogame conditions (playing a musical instrument alone or during social interaction) are expected to increase task engagement and improve motor learning capacity more than the classical paradigm.

This research is a critical step in further expanding the range of low-cost, non-pharmacological interventions which can easily be implemented outside the clinical setting (i.e. at home) and tailored to one’s needs/preferences, hence contributing to the advancement of personalized tele-interventions means in Parkinson’s.;EN;;Academic

At least 54 RTKs exist in humans, which respond to extracellular signals delivered by more than 100 different ligands. As most cells are exposed to many diverse stimuli at the same time, specific intracellular mechanisms (patterns) of RTK signalling must exist, allowing cells to accurately respond to their environment. Precise characterization of such patterns remains a major challenge of modern biology. Our previous research demonstrates that distinct, RTK-specific signalling patterns can be defined using current methodologies. We will integrate biochemistry, genetics and cell biology to obtain detailed characterization of signalling patterns of all human RTKs. Comparison of given RTK’s signalling in the context of an entire RTK family will allow for identification of key features determining the signalling pattern specific to each RTK. This will improve our basic understanding of RTK signalling, and aid development of novel treatment strategies for cancer and other diseases caused by RTK deregulation.;EN;;Academic

One of the biggest obstacles in production of pluripotent stem cells is i) reprogramming related genome destabilization and ii) adaptation of the cells to the culture conditions in vitro, accompanied by genome destabilization. To protect the genomic stability, pluripotent cells pose elevated base excision repair (BER) and homologous recombination (HR), while non homologous end joining (NHEJ) remains constant. We hypothesize, that the pathway choice affecting output error rate depends on the channeling of the base damage through BER mediated double stranded breaks to NHEJ, while unrepaired base damage triggering replicative stress-induced HR leaves the cells with more mutations. The aim is to characterize the individual pathways, proteins and substrate processing participating on the pathway choice in non adapted and adapted hESC and hiPSC.;EN;;Academic

FGF signal via activation of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1-4) to regulate a variety of developmental and regenerative processes. Aberrant FGFR activation frequently leads to disease. Activating mutations in FGFR3 alone account for at least 10 conditions, including syndromes affecting skeletal development, skin and cancer. Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase represents a major mediator of the FGFR function, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown. 
Our preliminary experiments point to a complex regulatory networks that operate at many different subcellular levels to allow for prolonged ERK activation in FGFR signaling. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, interactions of FGFRs with the protein members of their signaling complexes, processes governing active FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR-ERK signal. Through a combination of mathematical modelling, genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry approaches, we will describe, for the first time, the regulatory networks mediating prolonged activation of ERK pathway, in major biological processes regulated by FGFRs. These will include pathological FGFR signaling in skeletal dysplasias and cancer, and physiological FGFR signaling in maintenance of pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC).
 Unraveling of the mechanisms regulating FGFR-ERK signaling, proposed in this project, not only holds a key to our understanding of the basic mechanics of FGFR signal transduction, but will also aid an identification of novel therapeutic targets for pathological conditions caused by aberrant FGFR signaling.";EN;;Academic

Pathological synapse development and/or function result in many neuropsychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation, and Alzheimer’s disease. It is of fundamental and clinical importance to understand the biochemical, cell and molecular biological basis of synaptic function and plasticity. The functional synapses heavily depend upon healthy postsynaptic density (PSD), which is a cytoskeletal organization close to the postsynaptic membrane. SHANK3 is a key element of the PSD.

The DDR network of checkpoint and repair pathways counterbalances the potentially mutagenic effects of endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging assaults, thereby avoiding and/or delaying the onset of life-threatening diseases, neurodegenerative and immunological disorders, premature aging or cancer. Despite the recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of the DDR, many mechanistic aspects, including genes and pathways of DNA damage recognition, replication fork maintenance and re-start, damage signalling, checkpoint control, DNA repair, or chromatin modulation remain to be discovered and/or characterized. In this proposal, six laboratories with complementary multidisciplinary expertise join forces to improve our current knowledge in this area of biomedicine. In particular, we hypothesize that an omnipotent threat to genomic integrity in all proliferating cells may represent the major source of genomic instability that leads to cancer or other diseases. We aim to: 1) characterise the role of selected nucleases/glycosylases in DDR pathways with main focus on their regulation and redundancy. In particular, we will focus on protein-mediated interactions and post-translational modification by SUMOylation; 2) optimize hits identified in the pilot experiments with the aim to identify novel organic compounds with targeted biological activity that would be superior to known inhibitors; 3) identify genetic backgrounds that confer sensitivity (SSL phenotype) to a simultaneous inhibition of activity of selected key genome stability-associated genes, which may be potentially exploitable in the clinic. 
This Project will also provide insights into coordination of DNA replication, recombination and repair, and generate and validate small molecule modulators of key DDR enzymes as biological tools to better understand the DDR machinery and its disease-predisposing aberrations.

They are very diverse molecules in terms of size, microbial targets, mode of action, release from producer cells, and immunity mechanisms of the producing strains. With an increasing need for alternatives for existing antibiotic therapies in the last decades, bacteriocins are one of the most hopeful alternatives to “classical” antibiotics. The main feature distinguishing colicins (i.e. bacteriocins produced by enterobacteria) from classical antibiotics is that colicins have a relatively narrow killing spectrum. This colicin specificity is caused by highly specific molecular interactions of a colicin molecule with components of a cell envelope of susceptible bacteria (receptor molecules). Since the molecular interactions responsible for colicin specificity are still not fully understood, this project focuses on the identification of epitopes that underlie the receptor specificity of selected colicin types with medical potential. For detailed characterization of these epitopes, an interdisciplinary approach comprising structural biology and molecular biology methods will be used. Based on the detailed understanding of specific colicin-bacterium interactions, we plan to construct novel colicin variants with directed antimicrobial specificity. Synthetic variants of colicins with modified activity spectra could be a starting point for new alternative or supplementary antibiotic therapies.;EN;;Academic

Similarly, many individuals are genetically predisposed to ritualized behavior and appear to engage in these behaviors in order to reduce stress. Yet the way in which ritualized behaviors may allay stress across individuals, and in different social contexts, remains unknown. Previous research in this area has suffered from 3 major shortcomings:  1) a reliance on self-report data that fails to recognize the complexity of rituals, 2) it ignores individual variance in physiological stress profiles, and 3) has suffered from a lack of interdicipinary collaboration. The proposed research directly addresses these shortcomings by developing a highly interdisciplinary team to run field experiments on naturally occurring rituals in Fiji, Slovakia, and Serbia, and controlled laboratory experiments to investigate how ritual behavior impacts a person's homonal stress levels. In both the laboratory and the field we will use cutting-edge technology to assess the effects of different types and aspects of ritual behavior on stress responses by measuring physiological responses (heart rate, galvanic skin response), salivary steroid hormones (cortisol/testosterone/estradiol) and brain natriuretic peptide levels. The proposed research therefore represents an innovative study of a significant aspect of human behavior at the hormonal, behavioral, and socio-cultural levels. The research has the potential to inform a longstanding topic interest in many disciplines, and will do so in such a way as to elucidate the connections between diverse behavioral forms and physiological stress levels.;EN;;

This natural human activity carries formidable epistemic, metabolic and material costs without any apparent benefits and therefore yields an evolutionary puzzle which is exemplified especially in extreme rituals often involving enormous physiological costs, body mutilation, pain or sacrifice of precious resources. We encounter those in religious ceremonial practices as well as in military rituals or other types of initiative hazing. Given such costs, some evolutionary theorists argue that rituals must provide, or in the ancestral past must have provided, countervailing adaptive benefits. A long-standing tradition of social scientists stressed the role of collective rituals in the building of social cohesion and in-group trust (connected, on the other hand, with increase of out-group hostility). However, these assumptions have been rarely empirically tested and we still lack physiological mechanisms mediating these effects. Moreover, any real progress in this topic has been so far obstructed by fragmentary approach of separate disciplines. We therefore propose a series of studies conducted on multiple levels of analysis (from hormonal level to intra-/inter-group dynamics level) to elucidate (i) possible effects of extreme rituals on social cohesion, and (ii) purported working mechanisms behind these effects. By creating a highly integrative interdisciplinary team of top-rated scholars using diverse methodologies (ethnographic, experimental, mathematical modelling, social network analysis), we plan to bring novel understanding of the societal functions of extreme rituals and significantly contribute to understanding of this type of human behaviour.;EN;;Academic

The STN is thought to be prominently involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). As such it has become a main therapeutic target for PD treatment. Inactivation of the STN by deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves motor deficits. On the other hand mild to moderate impairment of cognitive functions after STN-DBS is reported in some patients. Thus, besides its key role in motor functions STN is by most authors also accepted to have impact on non-motor functions. The STN seems to have an anatomically central position within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical associative and limbic loops. Moreover, hypothesis of cortico-STN bypass of the BG-thalamocortical circuitry under some circumstances was introduced recently suggesting that such “hyperdirect” connections might underlie the processing of some of the non-motor functions. As the exact role of the STN in non-motor functions as well as mechanisms of cognitive after-effects of STN-DBS are yet unknown, we propose to characterize the cortico-subcortical functional connectivity in PD patients using high density EEG and simultaneous intracranial EEG in STN. In this project we will investigate: 1) whether neuro-electric activity of STN recorded with intracerebral electrodes during cognitive task differs among specific functional microstates defined with simultaneous high density scalp EEG recording, and 2) how parameters of DBS influence the temporal organization of the topographic configuration of the scalp potential fields. We believe that combination of high density EEG with deep brain recording and stimulation may allow conclusions about the role of STN in the cognitive functional networks involved in the generation of the EEG microstates.

Furthermore, previously unexpected links between centrosome anomalies and a plethora of human diseases and developmental defects have been uncovered. This in turn raises the prospect of exploiting centrosome-related pathways for therapeutic applications. Moreover, recent evidence from in vivo models (fly, mice) strongly suggests a context-dependent role for a centrosome in proliferation and differentiation. Hence, this raises an intriguing possibility of cell type-specific requirements for a correct number of centrosomes during their proliferation and terminal differentiation. However, our current understanding of the role of centrosome in such processes is surprisingly sparse.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the ability of unlimited proliferation, and can differentiate into any cell type of interest. Moreover, recent technological development has enabled to efficiently utilize methods of stable transgene expression or RNA interference also in human ESCs. These features make them very suitable candidates to study the function of centrosome in proliferation and differentiation, in the context of non-transformed human cells.

This project aims to bridge communication gaps between trainers and health service managers, including their respective institutions to ensure that management training programmes are appropriate and relevant to the needs of health care organisations and those of the learners. The project will build on the lessons generated from a previous Leonardo Mobility Project - DEPROHEALTH that specifically focused on identifying and developing core competencies for tomorrow’s health care managers, including the use of e-learning technology to deliver training.
The objectives of the proposed project (BEaM Health) are as follows:
• Establish and develop a platform for communication between educators of health management and health service managers in Europe.
• Support the development of joint curriculum of health service management training programme that addresses the core competencies for tomorrow’s health care managers.
• Use and evaluate innovative approaches for learning and teaching of tomorrow’s health managers through enhanced use of health service management attachments and e-learning technology.
• Undertake disseminations of lessons learned for wider replication of experience in Europe and globally.
Rationale:
Partners in the previous DEPROHEALTH were able to develop and test the core competencies of tomorrow’s health care managers as  well as use a form of e-learning technology in delivering a training module in change management (a core competency). The learning from this project can be taken further to improve the quality of health management training programmes in Europe though expansion on access to training, and ensure better linkages between the skills and knowledge that are developed through training and those that are actually needed at the work place, hence making training more relevant to the needs of health care organisations.
Characteristics of consortium:
• Academic institutions involved in training of health  service managers. Specific experience include e-learning technology, curriculum design, and innovative approaches in training - placements.  
• Health Management Association  that represent the health managers.  
Tangible and intangible outcomes:

However, changes in cell phenotype that do not show alterations in cell morphology, karyotype composition, genome re-arrangements or simply are not covered by particular molecular markers may stay unrecognized. Advanced bioanalytical methods, such matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization – time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) provide a powerful tool for discrimination and characterization of various chemical compounds, dependent on their mass to charge ratio (m/z). MALDI-TOF mass spectra generated from ionized molecules desorbed from the whole cells and tissues are very complex and depend strongly on the experimental conditions, matrix choice, machine setup or even the operator skill. However, they may serve as input data for sophisticated mathematical analysis, e.g. artificial intelligence or artificial neural networks (AI/ANN) resulting in complementary image of cell or tissue compositions. Direct whole cell- or tissue-MALDI-TOF MS followed by AI/ANN bypass the need for particular markers and/or direct observation that is sometimes limited. By using anonymous mass spectra aligned with already known characteristics may provide fast, robust and independent method for recognition of the whole cells and tissues and to be suitable even for automated diagnostics. This projects aims for adaptation of current MALDI-TOF technology for cytological and histological evaluations and together with AI/ANN develop a framework for diagnosing of tissue samples, archive slides or clinical-grade cell cultures.;EN;;Academic

Například u některých IPP stále neznáme přesnou patofyziologii vzniku tohoto onemocnění, ani účinnou kauzální léčbu. Co se týče nádorů plicní tkáně, zde sice máme k dispozici různé terapeutické možnosti, nicméně i přesto je prognóza pacientů závažná. Proto je velice důležité plicní tkáň studovat a zejména se pokusit vytvořit v laboratoři trojrozměrné modely zdravé i patologické plicní tkáně ve zdraví i nemoci, které by umožnily lépe pochopit průběh těchto plicních onemocnění, případně moci i na těchto modelech otestovat nově vyvíjená léčiva a umožnit tak do budoucna personalizaci léčby přesně na míru pacienta. V tomto projektu budeme modelovat plicní tkáň podléhající intersticiálním plicním procesům (idiopatická plicní fibróza, sarkoidóza) a nádorové transformaci. Pro pochopení patogeneze a personalizaci modelu je extrémně důležité získat lidské buňky, které jediné jsou relevantní pro poznávání patogeneze onemocnění a hledání nových terapeutických možností. Takovéto buňky je možné použít přímo v podobě izolace primárních buněk, či z nich získat indukované pluripotentní kmenové buňky a tyto diferencovat do terminálně diferencovaných buněčných typů plicní tkáně. Následně se dají buňky zkombinovat s buněčným nosičem – decelularizovanou extracelulární hmotou plic, která rekapituluje základní architekturu a bioaktivitu plicní tkáně. Toto nám umožní vytvořit 3D model plicní tkáně v laboratorních podmínkách a využít jej pro výzkumné účely. Studiem vzorků lidské plicní tkáně a laboratorně vytvořených plicních modelů bude umožněno detailnější pochopení vzájemných vztahů a funkčních souvislostí mezi buňkami za podmínek zdraví a nemoci, konkrétně patogeneze IPP a nádorů plic. V budoucnu by tak mohlo být možné lépe porozumět patogenezi těchto onemocnění a na vzniklých 3D modelech účinněji testovat léčiva

Kumulativní riziko selhání pro infekce kloubní náhrady (IKN) je nižší u primárních TEP kyčle v porovnání s TEP kolene. Incidence infekcí po revizních operacích může být až několika násobně vyšší v porovnání s incidencí IKN po primární operaci. Pokud však byla předchozí revize provedena pro IKN, je pravděpodobnost infekčního selhání ještě o něco vyšší a v čase plynule narůstá. V období  5 let od reoperace pro IKN je předpoklad recidivy infekce až u 14 % pacientů s TEP kyčlí a kolen. Opakované operace v terénu předchozího přístupu jsou zatížené zvýšeným rizikem zhoršeného hojení kožního krytu a tím vzniku IKN. U takovýchto „nestabilních“ ran se zvýšeným rizikem prosakování je preventivní použití podtlakové terapie vhodným léčebným postupem. Mechanizmus účinku je odsátí krve či exsudátu, zmenšení otoku, snížení tlaku v tkáních a zlepšení prokrvení.

Mají většinou rychlý a agresivní průběh a ovlivňují tak život nejen pacienta, ale i jeho okolí. Nejdůležitějším cílem péče o tyto jedince je tedy pokud možno úplné vyléčení nemoci (je-li to možné), nebo alespoň dosažení dlouhodobé remise, aby se pacient mohl vrátit zpět do běžného života. 

Nutné je proto nejen včasné rozpoznání onemocnění, ale také jeho přesná diagnostika a podání kvalitní terapie. Velkým příslibem je zavádění tzv. personalizované medicíny, která umožňuje pacientovi upravit léčbu podle jeho potřeb včetně snížení nežádoucích účinků na minimum, přičemž komplexně posuzuje různé faktory ovlivňující působení dané terapie. 

Součástí léčby bývají velmi často infekční komplikace – řadí se dokonce k častější příčině úmrtí než choroba samotná. Aby tedy nedošlo k bezprostřednímu ohrožení života nemocného, je nevyhnutelné včas a správně rozpoznat původce infekce a začít s vhodnou a účinnou léčbou.

I přes aktuálně dostupná pilotní data z dospělé populace, není měření hloubky anestezie u dětských pacientů standardem. Hloubka anestezie může být rizikovou součástí anestezie, jelikož může být spojena se zvýšeným výskytem perioperačních a pooperačních komplikací. Pediatrická populace je stran výskytu perioperační bdělosti obzvláště riziková vzhledem na minimum dostupných dat a taktéž na omezenou možnost pooperačního screeningu perioperační bdělosti zejména u menších dětí.

Úvod a zdůvodnění:
Perioperační měření hloubky anestezie (a event. analgezie) je aktuálně doporučená součást běžné anesteziologické praxe. Optimální hloubka anestezie v případě měření pomocí bispektrálního indexu (BIS) je mezi hodnotami 40-60. Mělčí (BIS nad 60) anestezie může být asociována se zvýšeným výskytem epizod perioperační bdělosti, a hlubší (BIS pod 40) anestezie může vést k častějšímu výskytu nežádoucích účinků anestezie, včetně hemodynamické nestability.

Hypotéza této studie je, že v průběhu anestezie bez perioperačního měření hloubky anestezie může docházet k fluktuacím hloubky anestezie mimo doporučená rozmezí. Počet fluktuací a kumulativní čas mimo rozmezí (40-60 BIS) může být asociován s výskytem pooperačních komplikací jako pooperační delirium (definováno hodnotou PAED skóre (Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium Score) nad 10, nebo nad 12– 2 metodiky měření), výskytem pooperační nauzey a zvracení (PONV) a výskytem jiných pooperačním komplikací (respirační, hemodynamické).
Primární outcome:
Kumulativní čas strávený mimo doporučené rozmezí pro hloubku anestezie
Sekundární outcome:
-	incidence fluktuací BIS mimo doporučené rozmezí (definované jako >30 vteřin mimo rozmezí doporučené hloubky anestezie, ukončeno návratem do definovaného rozmezí)
-	schopnost anesteziologa reagovat na dané fluktuace definovaná jako reakce ANO/NE + typ intervence (podání i.v. anestetika, opioidu, sedativ, relaxace, prohloubení inhalační anestezie, jiná)
-	latence reakce anesteziologa na danou fluktuaci – definovaná ve vteřinách od vzniku fluktuace po ukončení fluktuace = návrat do doporučeného pásma hloubky anestezie

Antipsychotika druhé generace jsou doporučována jako léky první volby vzhledem k jejich vyšší účinnosti a nízkému výskytu nežádoucích účinků. Bohužel až 30 % pacientů nereaguje na farmakoterapii. Klozapin (CLO) je antipsychotikum ze skupiny MARTA, je antagonistou dopaminových receptorů typu 2 (D2) a serotoninu typu 2A (5-HT2A). Je indikován zejména u pacientů rezistentních k farmakoterapii antipsychotiky první nebo druhé volby a některými autory je považován za nejúčinnější antipsychotikum vůbec. Koncentrace CLO je spojena nejen s klinickou odpovědí, ale i s vedlejšími účinky závislými na dávce, kde jsou nejzávažnější generalizované tonicko-klonické záchvaty. Terapeutické monitorování léčiv (TDM) tedy může vést k individuálnímu dávkování k dosažení cílové expozice a prevenci vedlejších účinků závislých na dávce. TDM se tradičně provádí z plazmy získané po odběru venózní krve, což může být pro některé pacienty stresující. Mikroodběrové metody a techniky jsou méně invazivní; nejrozšířenější mezi nimi je odběr suché krevní skvrny (DBS). Druhou vhodnou matricí pro monitorování AED jsou sliny nebo suchá kapka slin. Mini-invazivní odběr vzorků by mohl vést ke zvýšené dostupnosti TDM a důkladnější kontrole požadovaných hladin CLO, lepšímu dodržování léčby, snížené frekvenci nežádoucích účinků, stejně jako samoodběru doma a snížení stresu pacientů. Nové matrice vzorků vyžadují důkladnou klinickou validaci. Primárním cílem projektu je vyvinout nové analytické metody pro TDM CLO. s využitím alternativních matric (DBS, sliny) a ověřit jejich použití v klinické praxi v rámci nemocniční péče.

Naším cílem je provést důkladnou klinickou validaci metod a porovnat koncentrace CLO nacházejících se v plazmě s hodnotami v DBS a/nebo slinách odebraných současně. Získané výsledky následně statisticky vyhodnotit. Dále bude nastavena interní kontrola kvality pro TDM CLO v nových matricích.

Deregulace ER procesů, způsobená dědičnou mutací, onkogenní transformací či narušenou homeostázou organismu může vést k nesprávnému skládání a lokalizaci proteinů, a způsobovat tak ER stres. Prvotní odpovědí buňky na ER stres je tzv. unfolded protein response (UPR), jejíž cílem je obnovení proteinové rovnováhy; pokud tato odpověď selže, nastupuje buněčná smrt. Mohutný ER stres doprovází celou řadu patologií včetně hematologických malignit, a jeho míra obvykle negativně koreluje s prognózou pacienta. To naznačuje že ER stres není nádory pouze tolerován, ale je jimi pravděpodobně upřednostňován; mechanismy tohoto jevu však nejsou příliš známy.
Chronická lymfocytární leukémie (CLL) je nejčastější leukémií seniorů na západní polokouli. Existuje několik léčebných přístupů CLL, i přesto však CLL zůstává neléčitelnou chorobou. Vývoj nových léčebných přístupů je proto velmi žádaný. Naše předběžná data ukazují, že leukemické buňky CLL pacientů a Eµ-TCL1 myší mají upregulovaný UPR signaling, což koreluje s retencí povrchových receptorů v ER či jejich degradací. Také jsme zjistili, že konvenční CLL terapie pravděpodobně zvyšuje ER stres, čímž může přispívat k progresi onemocnění kvůli snížené dostupnosti terapeutických cílů. Tato data naznačují, že  terapie mířená proti mechanismům ER stresu by mohla obnovit membránovou prezentaci antigenů a tím zlepšit průběh CLL onemocnění. Naše data také ukazují, že lidské i myší CLL buňky everexprimují antiapoptické proteiny FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2) a API5 (apoptosis inhibitor 5). Inhibice FGF2/API5 signalizace by mohla senzitizovat CLL buňky k buněčné smrti a představovat tak nový terapeutický cíl v léčbě CLL.

Cílení na mitochondrie může být racionální strategií v migrastatických a antimetastatických přístupech léčby rakoviny. Pentamethiniové soli vázající se na mitochondriální kardiolipin (PMS) vykazují slibné migrastatické vlastnosti. Akumulují se v mitochondriích nádorových buněk a zároveň snižují jejich pohyblivost, migraci a invazivní potenciál. Cílení na mitochondrie má však určitá omezení. Nádorové buňky jsou flexibilní a mohou kompenzovat ztrátu mitochondriální produkce ATP exogenním mitochondriálním transferem z hostitelských buněk v mikroprostředí nádoru. Ukázalo se, že přenesené mitochondrie mění metabolismus recipientních buněk a tento proces byl popsán jak mezi nádorovými buňkami, tak mezi nádorovými buňkami a stromálními buňkami v nádorovém mikroprostředí.;CZ;;employee, student

Přibližně 70 % pacientů má pokročilé stadium onemocnění a část z nich (cca 20 %) špatně reaguje na radioterapii či chemoradioterapii (RT/CRT). RT/CRT v takových rezistentních případech neposkytuje terapeutický účinek, ale mohla by zvýšit nežádoucí vedlejší účinky. Bylo zjištěno, že bakterie ústní a střevní mikroflóry mohou přispět k terapeutické odpovědi a faktory jimi produkované, mohou ovlivnit výsledný efekt léčby. RT/CRT také narušuje střevní bariéru. Tento proces může vést k proniknutí patogenů do těla a vzniku sepse. Jako nadějné markery nepříznivých reakcí na RT/CRT budeme zkoumat nevhodné složení ústní a střevní mikroflóry, markery propustnosti střevní bariéry a dysbiózu.

Kromě genové terapie jsou pro léčbu tohoto onemocnění vyvíjeny léčivé přípravky moderní terapie (ATMPs) založené na allogenních MSC. 
Z regulačního hlediska představují MSCs porůstající biologicky rozložitelnou polykaprolaktonovou (PCL) kostru kombinovaný ATMP, který vyžaduje i) klinicky využitelné MSCs vyráběné v prostorách s certifikací SVP (k dispozic u projektového týmu a ii) klinicky využitelné biomembrány schválené pro použití jako zdravotnický prostředek. Výroba MSC klinické kvality musí být prováděna v SVP zařízení certifikovaném pro výrobu buněčných výrobků, kontrolu kvality, balení a distribuci (k dispozici u projektového týmu). Projektový tým má tedy potenciál vyvinout a předložit regulátorovi ke schválení kombinovaný ATMP založený na MSC/PCL pro terapii EB.

Dle histopatologických prognostických markerů (klinické stádium, histologický typ, grade a invaze do lymfovaskulárního prostoru) se pacientky stratifikují do skupin s nízkým nebo vysokým rizikem recidivy. Zatímco u pacientek s nízkým rizikem recidivy je za adekvátní terapeutický postup považována hysterektomie s bilaterální adnexektomií, u vysoce rizikových případů je doporučována stagingová pánevní a paraaortální lymfadenektomie včetně chirurgické intervence a adjuvantní léčby (radio/chemoterapie). Přesto dochází až u 20 % pacientek s nízkým rizikem k recidivě onemocnění a adjuvantní léčba by pro ně tedy byla přínosem. Proto je v současné době kladen důraz na identifikaci nových přístupů, které by zpřesnili stratifikaci pacientek dle skutečného rizika recidivy. Jedním z těchto přístupů je sledování mutačního stavu genu pro polymerázu epsilon (POLE), imunohistochemické vyšetření proteinu p53 a vyšetření defektu proteinů tzv. mismatch rapir systému (MMR deficience). Jako slibné se také jeví sledování mutačního stavu L1-CAM a hodnocení positivity estrogenových (ER) a progesteronových (PR) receptorů. Dalším přístupem je použití technik sekvenování nové generace (NGS), kterými lze nejenom detekovat mutační stav uvedených genů a mikrosatelitovou instabilitu související s MMR deficiencí, ale také vyšetřit další geny a stanovit komplexní molekulární profil nádoru.

Medián přežití pacientů s nejčastěji se vyskytujícím difuzně infiltrujícím gliomem, multiformním glioblastomem (GBM), se pohybuje od 12 do 15 měsíců od stanovení diagnózy. Navzdory významnému pokroku v diagnostice mozkových nádorů a moderním terapeutickým přístupům je léčba pacientů s maligními gliomy stále velmi omezená. Mnohé studie uvádějí, že nekódující RNA (ncRNA) jako jsou dlouhé nekódující RNA (lncRNA) a mikroRNA (miRNA) mají klíčovou úlohu v molekulárních mechanismech spojených s patogenezí gliomů. Cirkulární RNA (circRNA) jsou podtypem ncRNA a se svou délkou až 4 000 páru bází patří pod skupinu lncRNA. Současný rychlý vývoj sekvenačních metod a bioinformatických přístupů pomohl identifikovat tisíce eukaryotických circRNA a změny exprese těchto molekul byly nalezeny v různých vývojových stadiích, fyziologických podmínkách a orgánových systémech, včetně nervového systému. Jejich důležitá role byla prokázána také ve vývoji gliomu. Tyto molekuly jsou výsledkem nekanonické sestřihové události zvané zpětný sestřih, ve které je 3' konec transkriptu kovalentně spojen s 5' koncem, což vede k vytvoření spojité smyčky. Bylo zjištěno, že circRNA v těle mohou reverzibilně vázat specifické miRNA, čímž jim brání ve vazbě na jejich vlastní molekulární cíle. Tímto způsobem lze regulovat posttranskripční umlčování některých genů zprostředkované molekulami miRNA. Na základě tohoto jevu jsou circRNA označovány jako tzv. „sponge“ miRNA. Tato schopnost, společně s jejich stabilitou v tělních tekutinách může vést k předpokladu, že circRNA mohou být potenciálními biomarkery pro predikci rizika nádorového onemocnění včetně gliomu. Předkládaný projekt se zaměřuje na globální profilování circRNA, funkční in vitro a in vivo analýzy včetně použití technologie CRISPR/Cas9. Cílem není pouze srovnání globálních expresních profilů circRNA ve tkáni a likvoru pacientů s gliomem a nenádorových pacientů, ale také celkové hlubší porozumění biologii circRNA, objasnění circRNA-miRNA-mRNA signálních drah a navržení nových možných molekulárních cílů v léčbě gliomů.

Nositelné senzory měřící fyziologické parametry jsou čím dál dostupnější jak pro vědecké využití, tak pro širokou veřejnost. Zvyšující se dostupnost nositelných senzorů je velkou výhodou pro výzkum jednak z toho důvodu, že takový senzor je relativně malý ve srovnání se stolními přístroji, nevyžaduje drátové připojení a nebrání tak participantovi v pohybu. Senzory také většinou připomínají denně používané předměty (hodinky, náramky či prstýnky) a tak je jejich použití příjemnější ve srovnání se stolními přístroji. Další velkou výhodou je to, že měření nemusí být uskutečněno v laboratoři, ale může probíhat v prostředí, které je pro daný výzkum přirozené a scénář sestavený pro měření může být dynamický.

HPO je tedy tudíž závažně život ohrožující onemocnění. Protože farmakoterapie je u HPO pouze symptomatická, byly vyvinuty psychoterapie specificky zaměřené na léčbu této poruchy. Mezi těmito přístupy se Dialektická behaviorální terapie (DBT) dosud jeví jako jedna z nejúčinnějších. Největším problém DBT je však vysoké procento pacientů, kteří léčbu nedokončí (v průměru kolem 28%). Mezi další možné způsoby léčby HPO patří repetitivní transkraniální magnetická stimulace (rTMS). Tato metoda léčby přináší podle dosavadní literatury rychlé zlepšení v oblastech emoční dysregulace a impulzivity, avšak trvání efektů zřejmě není delší než několik týdnů nebo měsíců. Cílem tohoto projektu je překonat největší problémy obou terapeutických přístupů (vysoký dropout v DBT a krátké trvání efektu rTMS) jejich zkombinováním. 48 pacientů s HPO podstoupí 3 týdny prefrontální aktivní nebo shamové rTMS a poloviny z těchto pacientů dále také podstoupí komplexní DBT program trvající 24 týdnů. V několika časových bodech budeme měřit behaviorální i neurální efekty intervencí. Projekt je jedním z prvních vůbec, které se zabývají možností rTMS augmentovaná psychoterapie, a zodpoví současně na otázky, zda je aktivní prefrontální rTMS účinnější než shamová rTMS (placebo) a zda může být efekt DBT augmentován pomocí rTMS. Projekt tak zároveň může přinést možnost využívání rTMS jako krátké efektivní intervence u pacientů, kteří čekají na DBT, protože čekací jsou velmi dlouhé. Projekt rovněž zahrnují hodnocení neurálních změn po rTMS a DBT intervencích a měření v několika časových bodech nám umožní sledovat dlouhodobý vývoj efektu intervencí. Tato studie tudíž přinese několik unikátních příspěvků do současnému poznání ohledně léčby HPO a může významně zlepšit možnosti léčby HPO.;CZ;;academic, employee

Především nebývá napadena plicní tkáň jako u všech předešlých variant koronaviru. Stále častěji jsou zaznamenávány případy lidí s tzv. post-covidovým syndromem, tedy lidí, kteří se vyléčili z onemocnění COVID-19, avšak přesto se potýkají s různými zdravotními problémy. Pro výzkum COVID-19 bychom chtěli použít jedinečnou sadu více než 4 000 vzorků od 90 zemřelých po COVID-19, kteří byly infikováni variantami beta a delta. Během pandemie od října 2020 do dubna 2021 byly odebrány vzorky.  Projekt se primárně zaměří na sledování výskytu viru SARS-CoV-2 ve tkáních, orgánech a tělních tekutinách. Bude určena virová nálož v jednotlivých vzorcích a případný typ mutace viru. Vzhledem k nezastupitelné roli ACE2 receptoru při SARS-CoV-2 infekci bude velká pozornost věnována genu pro tento receptor.

Postradiační xerostomie je jednu z nejčastějších komplikací radioterapie pro zhoubné nádory hlavy a krku. Doposud není žádná léčba, která by tuto komplikaci dokázala spolehlivě vyřešit. Jedním z nejnovějších přístupů, jak léčit postradiační xerostomii je použití mezenchymálních kmenových buněk (MSC), které jsou aplikovány do postižených slinných žláz. Výsledky této terapie v klinických zkoušeních neodpovídají dobrému efektu léčby na zvířecích modelech. Z toho je odvoditelná potřeba dalšího výzkumu mechanismů, které brání žádoucím diferenciačním trajektoriím MSC.

Cíl studie:

Materiál a metody: 
100-120 pacientů bude zařazeno do studie. Bude měřena sekreční aktivita slinných žláz, mapována ultrasonografická struktura, chemické složení slin a kvalita života pacientů s postradiační xerostomií, konkomitačně provedení retrospektivní imunohistochemické studie existujícím materiálu na 45 vzorků slinných žláz po radioterapii a srovnání proti vzorkům slinných žláz bez provedené radioterapie.

Vyskytují se u ní obvykle dva patologické rysy: 1) extracelulární beta-amyloidní plaky (Aß) a 2) intraneuronální Tau obsahující neurofibrilární spleti (P-Tau). 23 % světové populace je nositelem genu APOE4, kódujícího Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), který je největším genetickým rizikovým faktorem pro rozvoj sporadické formy AD. Hlavní hypotézou patologie ApoE4 u AD je, že přispívá k akumulaci Aß a P-Tau. Klinické studie, jejichž cílem bylo zabránit ukládání P-Tau nebo Aß, však neprokázaly účinnost v léčbě AD. To naznačuje, že agregace proteinů pravděpodobně není příčinou, ale spíše důsledkem neznámých mechanismů, které nakonec vedou k patologii AD. Za povšimnutí stojí, že kognitivně zdraví nositelé APOE4 mají zvýšenou hladinu buněčných volných kyslíkových radikálů (ROS) a narušenou hipokampální neurogenezi, což jsou jevy pozorované i u AD. Zvýšené hladiny ROS vedou k depozici Aß, které následně zvyšují produkci ROS, a vytvářejí tak začarovaný kruh. Při fyziologických hladinách však ROS hrají roli druhých poslů regulujících řadu signálních drah. Mnohé z nich jsou zapojené v řízení neurální diferenciace, depozice Aß a fosforylace Tau. Předpokládáme, že chronické zvýšení hladiny ROS způsobené ApoE4 moduluje klíčové signální dráhy řídící tyto procesy, což vede k rozvoji a postupu AD. Věříme, že kombinací citlivých analytických metod, jedinečného modelu cerebrálních organoidů založeného na kmenových buňkách a silné odborné znalosti v oblasti neurodiferenciace, ROS signálování a AD, budeme schopni identifikovat nové mechanismy, kterými ApoE4 přispívá k rozvoji AD.

Otázka zní: „Je možné použít ke spojení malých fragmentů kosti injektovatelné resorbovatelné kostní lepidlo, které po vytvrdnutí v kombinaci s vnitřní fixací umožní okamžité zatěžování poraněné končetiny?“ Hypotéza projektu tedy spočívá v injekční aplikaci nově vyvinutého vstřebatelného „samotuhnoucího“ kostního adheziva ve formě polotekuté pasty na tříštivé zlomeniny tak, aby se malé fragmenty kosti spojily dohromady jako puzzle a při doplnění o vnitřní osteosyntézu tak bylo umožněno prakticky okamžité plné zatěžování poraněné kosti, respektive přidruženého kloubu a tím nevznikly trvalé následky prodělané nitrokloubní zlomeniny. Kostní lepidlo modifikované bioadhezivy během tuhnutí při fyziologických podmínkách fixuje zlomeninu, pomalu se vstřebává a zároveň uvolňuje produkty hydroxyapatitu, čímž nastartuje primární hojení kosti, na jehož konci bude kompletně resorbované adhezivum, pevně zhojená kost bez nitrokloubních schodků a pacient připravený k okamžité rehabilitaci.

U kriticky nemocných pacientů jsou tyto komplikace často doprovázeny dysfunkcí či selháním dalších orgánů či systémů a proto jsou často považovány jako součást mnohočetného orgánového selhání (MOF). Optimální praktický management deliria a CIPM včetně jejich screeningu prevence a léčby je integrální součástí současných doporučení pro optimální intenzivní a kritickou péči, avšak stále existují velké mezery v našich znalostech o optimální a efektivní prevenci a léčbě těchto komplikací. Kognitivní a neuromuskulární komplikace kritického stavu byly dosud zkoumány odděleně. Primárními cíli navrhované multicentrické popisné sledovací 4leté studie ve dvou kohortách dospělých pacientů léčených na všeobecné a neurologické JIP a jedné pediatrické JIP v centrech dodržujících současná preventivní opatření zaměření na minimalizaci výskytu těchto komplikací a jejich následků bude prevalence ICU-deliria a CIPM a významnost jejich ovlivnitelných a neovlivnitelných predisponujících a vyvolávajících faktorů a jejich překryv. Sekundárními cíli bude nalezení optimální metody pro screening těchto komplikací a také pro diferenciální diagnostiku některých stavů které tyto komplikace napodobují nebo jejich diagnostiku ztěžují zejména nonkonvulzivní status epilepticus, afázie či generalizovaná slabost jiné etiologie. Dalším cílem bude studovat asociaci mezi poruchami spánku a výskytem deliria a tak ověřit roli spánku v patofyziologii deliria intenzivní péče.;CZ;;academic, employee

Endometrióza je onemocnění, při kterém se rozptýlená menstruační tkáň postupně rozrůstá mimo dělohu a způsobuje silné bolesti a neplodnost. Živé buňky endometriální tkáně unikají imunitnímu dozoru, což vede k akutnímu zánětu v peritoneálním mikroprostředí a významně zvýšenému riziku vzniku karcinomů vaječníků a prsu.
Gamma-delta T buňky představují efektorové lymfocyty vrozené imunity zapojené do imunitního dozoru jako první linie obrany proti infekcím a nádorům; tvoří méně než 10% T buněk v periferní krvi, ale nacházejí se také v tkáních včetně kůže, tenkého střeva, dělohy a vaječníků. Nedávno jsme jako první prokázali u pacientek s endometriózou přítomnost gamma-delta T lymfocytů v peritoneální tekutině a párovaných vzorcích periferní krve (Hudecek R. et al, Frontiers Immunol. 2021). Popsali jsme také prominentní vrozenou cytotoxickou reaktivitu gamma-delta T buněk izolovaných ze zdravých dárců proti KLE, RL-95 a Ishikawa endometriálním buněčným liniím.
Naším cílem je u pacientek s endometriózou analyzovat poruchy imunitní funkce rezidentních a rekrutovaných buněk zapojených do obrany v peritoneu. Také jsme detekovali populace endometriálních stromálních buněk, které v P2-P3 vykazovaly morfologii fibroblastů a fenotypem se podobaly mesenchymálním kmenovým buňkám (MSC).

Nepříznivá prognóza a krátký medián přežití po resekci a radio/chemoterapii kratší než 12 měsíců jsou způsobeny časnou recidivou nádoru. Imunitní mikroprostředí GBM nádoru je proto slibným cílem při vývoji průlomových imunoterapeutických léčebných postupů, zejména pak gamma-delta (γδ) T efektorové lymfocytů, u kterých jsme již ukázali vysokou reaktivitu na GBM nádor. Nedávno jsem identifikovali tumor-infiltrující γδ T buňky (TIL) v nádorech GBM u více než 75% pacientů. Potvrdili jsme významně rozdílné exprese proteinů kontrolních bodů B7-H1 a B7-H3, které odkazují na charakteristické změny hematoencefalické bariéry u GBM pacientů.
Naším cílem je studovat funkce γδ TIL lymfocytů, popsat jejich single-cell expresní profily, rozlišit GBM reaktivní vs nereaktivní populace na základě profilování chromatinu a genové regulace vybraných transkripčních faktorů včetně N-Myc. Cílem je identifikovat proteiny specificky exprimované na γδ TIL, provést silencing těchto genů a následně provést ověření v cytotoxických esejích. Naše výsledky dále popisují populace plazmacytoidních dendritických buněk (pDC) infiltrovaných v GBM nádoru u většiny pacientů. Plánujeme definovat jejich expresní profily, funkce a případné zapojení pDC v relapsu z důvodu rezistence na chemoterapii.

Jedním z hlavních společných projevů chronických onemocnění je omezení pohybové aktivity v důsledku přetrvávající dušnosti, které limituje každodenní život většiny nemocných. Mezi hlavní příčiny dušnosti patří slabost respiračního svalstva. Inovativní způsob, který může lépe popisovat stav dechového svalstva, představuje Test of Incremental Respiratory Endurance (TIRE), který se, na rozdíl od běžně používaných ústních tlaků, primárně zaměřuje na vytrvalost dechového svalstva, což je z hlediska běžných denních aktivit přínosnější. TIRE je popisováno řadou inovativních parametrů, které se v běžné klinické praxi v evropských zemích nepoužívají, a tudíž neexistují žádné normativní hodnoty pro zdravou populaci. Vytvoření normativních hodnot parametrů TIRE pro českou populaci přinese možnosti kvantifikace vytrvalosti dechového svalstva. Díky těmto hodnotám bude následně možné nejen lépe popsat funkční stav respiračního svalstva, ale také nastavit ideální parametry respiračního tréninku, což v současnosti možné není, protože normativní hodnoty parametrů TIRE neexistují a používané parametry ústních tlaků neposkytují pro tento účel dostatek informací. Tento projekt si dává za cíl změřit a vytvořit referenční hodnoty parametrů TIRE pro českou populaci (30 mužů a 30 žen v každé dekádě od 20 do 80 let) a tím nabídnout lepší možnosti hodnocení výkonnosti, resp. míry oslabení respiračního svalstva u pacientů s chronickými onemocněními (skupina 1).

Navíc je progrese plicní fibrózy u růzých pacientů extrémně variabliní a některé typy IPP mají vysoké riziko přesmyku ze stabilizovaného onemocnění do fatálního progresivního fibrotizujícícho fenotypu, známého jako progredující fibrotizující IPP. Vývoj nových léčiv je limitován zásadním nedostatkem znalostí o jejich spouštěcích a udržujících faktorech. V tomto projektu využijeme našich rozsáhlých zkušeností s tkáňovým inženýrstvím, biomateriály a bunečnou biologií a vytvoříme 3D modely IPP, vhodné k modelování chorob a testování léčiv. Zkombinujeme biomateriálové nosiče založené na decelularizované plicní tkáni s lidskými buňkami, a vytvoříme tak 3D modely plicní tkáně. Ustavíme linie lidských pluripotentních kmenových buněk (hiPSC) odvozené od krevních buněk pacientů s IPP, kteří jsou nositeli genetických mutací/variant spojených s IPP nebo trpících progredující fibrotizující formou IPP, a tyto hiPSC diferencujeme do plicních derivátů (plicní epitel, fibroblasty) specifických pro daného pacienta. Kombinací buněk odvozených od hiPSC a decelularizovaných nosičů vznikne „kompletní“ 3D plicní model IPP, kdy všechny buňky v modelu budou nositeli specifické vlastnosti relevantní pro rozvoj IPP, čímž dosáhneme nejrelevantnější aplikovatelnosti modelu. Podobným způsobem využijeme linie lidských embryonálních kmenových buněk (hESC) a vytvoříme „zdravý“ 3D model plicní tkáně, který bude sloužit jako kontrola, a do kterého můžeme vložit primární buňky pacientů s IPP a vytvořit 3D plicní model s „fibrotickým ložiskem“. V projektu ověříme, zda tyto modely mohou být vytvořeny standardizovaným a opakovatelným protokolem založeným na výše zmíněné strategii, a zda tyto modely replikují vlastnosti plicní tkáně ve zdraví a nemoci.

Ačkoliv se jedná o relativně malá čísla, jde o jedince v produktivním věku, jejichž prognóza je velice špatná a patogeneze tohoto onemocnění není uspokojivě objasněna. Často se jedná o nekuřáky či o relativně krátce kouřící jednice, lze tedy oproti starším nemocným uvažovat jinou kauzalitu nádorového onemocnění. Většina pacientů v této věkové podskupině je navíc diagnostikována s agresivními formami karcinomu plic. Genetické pozadí karcinomu plic s výskytem u pacientů mladších 40 let je málo prostudované a v literatuře je popsán pouze vyšší výskyt EML4-ALK translokací u nemalobuněčného karcinomu plic a mutací v EGFR genu. Naše preliminární analýzy však odhalily také potenciálně cílitelné mutace v genech pro BRAF, PIK3CA nebo amplifikaci genu HER2. Pokročilá diagnostika genetických aberací by proto u podskupiny pacientů s karcinomem plic do 40 let mohla pomoci identifikovat nové potenciální cíle onkologické léčby. Navrhovaný projekt bude realizován formou multicentrického náboru pacientů, přičemž cílem projektu je komplexní analýza molekulárně genetických změn karcinomů plic s časným výskytem. Snahou bude identifikovat spektrum možných genetických aberací v nádorové tkáni mimo běžně testované drivery (EGFR mutaci a ALK translokaci) pomocí sekvenování nové generace (hotspot onkologický panel, germinální exom, somatický exom, detekce fúzních genů). Získané výsledky by měly nejen rozšířit současnou úroveň vědeckého poznání o etiopatogenezi karcinomu plic, ale významně rozšířit léčebné možnosti v rámci individualizovaných léčebných plánů po vyčerpání standardních léčebných možností u mladých pacientů s karcinomem plic.;CZ;;academic, employee

Nezávislé (nesponzorované) studie s přísnými a přesnými metodami jsou zásadní pro farmakovigilanční snahy v souvislosti s vakcínami proti COVID-19 po celém světě. Vzhledem ke své nezávislé povaze a transparentnímu designu hrají tyto studie klíčovou roli při zvyšování úrovně proočkovanosti populací a důvěry veřejnosti vůči vakcínám. Navrhujeme multicentrickou prospektivní průřezovou a kohortovou studii ke sledování krátkodobých a dlouhodobých vedlejších účinků vakcín COVID-19. Studie využije samovyplňovací online dotazník pro několik cílových skupin: zdravotnické pracovníky, pedagogické a akademické pracovníky, studenty vysokých škol, nezletilé (do 18 let), seniory a těhotné a kojící ženy, kteří obdrželi alespoň jednu dávku jakékoli vakcíny COVID-19.

V projektu RecMap identifikujeme a klasifikujeme COVID-19 doporučené postupy, vyhodnocujeme jejich důvěryhodnost a poskytujeme doporučení zúčastněným stranám. RecMap představuje více než 1200 předem zkontrolovaných doporučení pro oblast klinické praxe, veřejného zdravotnictví a zdravotní politiky. RecMap se primárně zaměřuje na zdravotnictví, ale protože nejméně 450 doporučení se týká adolescentů a veřejného zdravotnictví, veřejnost bude také těžit z dostupných doporučení týkajících se zdraví. Způsob prezentace doporučení pro laiky musí být přizpůsoben jejich konkrétním potřebám.

Termín novorozenecká sepse je užíván k označení systémového onemocnění bakteriálního, virového nebo plísňového původu, které je spojené s významnými hemodynamickými změnami a klinickou manifestací ústící ve značnou morbiditu a mortalitu. Běžné laboratorní testy jako kultivace hemokultur, indexy leukocytů, reaktanty akutní fáze a srdeční frekvence mají u novorozenecké sepse limity v diagnostické přesnosti, zejména nízkou pozitivně prediktivní hodnotu. Tyto limity v kombinaci s nejednoznačnými klinickými příznaky, které se navíc překrývají s projevy nezralosti často nutí neonatology k vyloučení sepse z diferenciálně diagnostického postupu. Avšak je-li antibiotická terapie nasazena až při kompletních klinických projevech, je prognóza nepříznivá, na druhou stranu liberální antibiotická politika vede ke zvyšování rezistence mikroorganismů. V rámci předkládané studie bude výzkumná kohorta důsledně charakterizována pomocí standardních biochemických markerů zánětu (CRP, procalcitonin, prozánetlivé cytokiny), a pomocí metagenomických analýz střevního a krevního mikrobiomu. Profily cirkulující miRNA v séru budou analyzovány pomocí sekvenování nové generace a korelovány s se standardními biochemickými markery s cílem zhodnotit použitelnost miRNA jako časných ukazatelů nástupu a průběhu systémové infekce v krevním oběhu. Cílem je vytvoření panelu diagnostických a prognostických biomarkerů umožňujících podchytit sepsi v době, kdy je dle klinických příznaků nezachytitelná a předpovědět prognózu onemocnění.;CZ;;employee

Molekulární biomarkery používané k diagnostice, predikci prognózy a terapeutické odpovědi pacienta, jako jsou oligoklonální pásy, MRZ reakce nebo lehké řetězce neurofilament, nejsou pro chorobu dostatečně specifické, spíše odrážejí obecný zánětlivý proces. Biomarkery umožňující jednoznačnou diagnostiku, odhad prognózy a predikci individuální terapeutické odpovědi stále chybí.
Nekódující RNA (ncRNA) jsou definovány jako transkripty, které nejsou přeloženy do struktury proteinů. NcRNA byly v posledních letech prokázány jako slibné biomarkery u široké škály lidských onemocnění nejen díky jejich vysoké buněčné a tkáňové specificitě, ale také dobré stabilitě a snadnému získání z tkání, tělních tekutin a periferního krevního řečiště.
Krátké nekódující RNA jsou jedny z nejvíce zkoumaných molekul, zvláště specifická podskupina RNA transkriptů tvořených 18-25 nukleotidy zvaná mikroRNA (miRNA). Bylo prokázáno, že některé miRNA jsou asociované s rozvojem MS, nebo jsou schopné odlišit pacienty s různým subtypem onemocnění. Přesto jejich role u pacientů s MS není stále dostatečně prozkoumána a jejich potenciál není plně využit.
Předmětem studie je analyzovat profil volných nekódujících RNA, zejména miRNA v likvoru a krevní plazmě pacientů s podezřením, či již diagnostikovanou MS. Cílem je vytvoření diagnostických, prognostických a prediktivních panelů nekódujících RNA, pomocí kterých by bylo možné časně definovat pacienty s horší prognózou či léčebnou odpovědí. Analyzovány budou rovněž hladiny vybraných nekódujících RNA v čase s cílem otestovat korelaci hladin těchto nekódujících RNA s klinickým průběhem onemocnění.
Cílem projektu je výzkum nových biomarkerů, které by pomohly s vyšší senzitivitou a specificitou diagnostikovat pacienty s MS, dokázaly předpovědět budoucí klinický průběh a individualizovat terapii ve snaze předejít trvalé invaliditě.";CZ;;employee, student

However, in vitro generated retinal cells are often poorly differentiated with impaired functionality demonstrated by not fully developed photoreceptor outer segments and less synaptic connectivity, which can be contributed to the lack of natural instructive signals that is normally available in vivo. In this project we aim to address these limitations by introducing instructive signals using photo-stimulation of human retinal cells. We have developed a unique optical device for high-throughput multi-wavelength light illumination of retinal organoids. Our preliminary results clearly indicate that photo-stimulation of differentiating retinal cells leads to enhanced differentiation. The proposed strategy combines the innovative photo-stimulation approach with stem cell biology research, allowing to study photo-induced effects on retinal development from a uniquely different perspective.;CZ;;Academic

Celá desetiletí bylo primární cilium na okraji vědeckého zájmu. To se změnilo až v posledních letech kdy se studium této organely právem stalo jednou z nejaktraktivnějších oblastí buněčné biologie. Primární cilium plní funkci buněčné antény na povrchu buněk - slouží k přenosu signálu z okolí do nitra buňky (dráhy Shh, Wnt, PDGF), čímž hraje nepostradatelnou roli v buněčné odpovědi na podněty z okolí. Problematika regulace cilií není pouze „akademický problém“, ale má velice významný klinický aspekt, jelikož mutace komponent cilií souvisí se vznikem řady chorob a vývojových vad. Tau tubulin kináza 2 (TTBK2) je klíčovým regulátorem tvorby cilií (ciliogeneze) u obratlovců, mutace v TTBK2 genu jsou spojeny s vznikem neurologického onemocnění u lidí (spinocerebrální ataxie typ 11, SCA11). V současné době není přesně známo jakým molekulárním mechanismem TTBK2 reguluje ciliogenezi a zda (a případně jak) je její role v ciliogenezi spojena se vznikem SCA11, tj. zda se jedná o ciliopatii. Cílem tohoto projektu bude pomocí několika přistupů (in vitro kinázová esej, příprava stabilních buněčných linií, studium ciliogeneze pomocí buněčných modelů – RPE-1, HEK 293T) systematicky porovnat „wild type“ TTBK2 s mutatní TTBK2 v několika klíčových parametrech. Dá se očekávat, že získaná data, ať už na molekulární (např. rozdíl či ne ve schopnosti wt and mutatní TTBK2 fosforylovat testovaný substrát) nebo funkční úrovni (např. rozdíl či ne ve schopnosti wt and mutatní TTBK2 regulovat ciliogenezi), přispějí k objasnění role TTBK2 ve vývoji a patofyziologii.

Tyto struktury se nacházejí často v oblasti telomer, promotorů onkogenů, a promotorů transkripce a je tedy velmi pravděpodobné, že se mohou uplatňovat v regulaci patologických procesů, včetně nádorového bujení [1, 2] . 
Přírodní látky patří odpradávna k cenným zdrojům v oblasti léčení nebo prevence různých typů onemocnění, včetně nádorových. V klinické praxi je i dnes používána celá řada látek přírodního původu. Mnoho z nich se v praxi uplatnilo jako protinádorová léčiva. Přestože se jedná o poměrně dlouho známá léčiva, stále jsou v onkologii solidních nádorů velmi ceněná a často používaná (např. paklitaxel, vinblastin, etoposid). Mnohé z přírodních látek posloužily také jako inspirace pro chemickou syntézu účinných léčiv s akceptovatelným bezpečnostním profilem. 
Kvarterní benzo [c] fenanthridinové alkaloidy (QBA) jsou látky přírodního původu, nacházející se v léčivých rostlinách čeledí Papaveraceae, Fumariaceae a Rutaceae a vykazují řadů nadějných účinků (antimikrobní, antimykotické, protizánětlivé, protinádorové); QBA jsou tedy v poslední době intenzivně zkoumány coby potenciální léčiva a již byly prokázány některé typy interakcí vybraných QBA s konvenčními i nekanonickými formami DNA [3, 4]. Cílem tohoto projektu je studium interakcí QBA a jejich metabolitů a nekanonických forem DNA, jako je G-kvadruplex nebo i-motif. Stabilizace těchto struktur může významným způsobem ovlivnit regulaci transkripce a tedy řadu patofyziologických procesů, včetně kancerogeneze. QBA pro studium těchto interakcí budou izolovány z přírodních zdrojů a jejich metabolity budou připraveny v dostatečném množství biotransformačními reakcemi (metabolismus fáze I a II) a izolovány pomocí semipreparativní chromatografie. Charakterizace a identifikace bude provedena pomocí kapalinové chromatografie s hmotnostní spektrometrií (MS). Interakce QBA a jejich metabolitů bude studována pomocí spektrometrických technik (UV-Vis, fluorescence, cirkulárního dichroismu, MS) a kompetitivní dialýzy. U vysoce interagujících zástupců QBA bude testována cytotoxicita na buněčné úrovni. Objasněním interakcí QBA projekt přispěje k možnému využití QBA jako protinádorových léčiv.";CZ;;Academic

Vysoká míra odbornosti profesního výkonu je zajišťována mj. díky provázanosti profesí s vědními a studijními disciplínami pěstovanými na univerzitách – spojnicí mezi nimi je přípravné a další (celoživotní) vzdělávání profesionálů. Profese se nacházejí v tranzici – procházejí změnami způsobenými globálními trendy, resortními politikami, proměnami vědy i technologií a dalšími vlivy. Faktory, které tyto změny působí, mohou být v jednotlivých profesích odlišné, stejně jako obsah těchto změn. V některých oblastech změn dochází k prostupování profesí a v jiných ke vzniku nových profesí.

Spektrální CT nabízí kromě dynamiky sycení a měření denzit nové možnosti charakterizace ložiskových lézí, což by mohlo přispět k užší diferenciální diagnostice nádorů, odhadu jejich histopatologických subtypů, agresivity a predikci léčebné odpovědi. Další moderní metodou je PET/MR. PET/MR dokáže s velmi vysokou senzitivitou vyloučit již časnou disseminaci nádorového onemocnění. Informace z PET/MR může v kombinaci se spektrálním CT přinést další zpřesnění diferenciální diagnostiky nádorů s ambicí odlišit klinicky relevantní histologické subtypy. Neméně významný pokrok byl učiněn v rozvoji nových sekvencí MR.

Její zvýšená úroveň je klíčovým mechanismem v některých neurologických onemocněních, včetně epilepsie, a dle zdrojů sehrává roli i v genezi fyziologického déjà vu. Déjà vu je anomální paměťový fenomén, při kterém dochází k neadekvátnímu pocitu familiarity nově zažívané situace. Vyskytuje se u většiny zdravé populace, ale i jako doprovodný jev meziotemporální epilepsie. V těchto onemocněních dominují změny KE a strukturní změny v oblasti hipokampu. Podobný vzorec strukturních a metabolomických změn v temporálních lalocích byl v našich předešlých studiích identifikován i u zdravých osob s déjà vu. Předkládaný projekt má za úkol rozšířit poznatky o roli KE v genezi déjà vu u zdravých jedinců i epileptických pacientů v reakci na vizuální stimulaci. Získané poznatky povedou k lepšímu pochopení excitační rovnováhy u zdravých jedinců i pacientů s neurologickými onemocněními.  
Projekt B: Alzheimerova nemoc (AN) je nejčastější příčina demence ve stárnoucí populaci. Mírná kognitivní porucha (MKP-AN)  je časné stadium AN. Demence při AN má negativní dopad kvalitu života pacienta i pečovatele a je spojena s významným zvýšením morbidity/mortality. V projektu budeme zkoumat neurální koreláty paměťových poruch u pacientů s MKP-AN. MRI zobrazování mozku v kombinaci s neinvazivní mozkovou stimulací (NIMS) - repetitivní transkraniální magnetickou stimulací (rTMS), slouží jako další nástroj pro odhalení mechanismů kognitivních a behaviorálních symptomů. Pomocí NIMS můžeme navodit změny plasticity a funkce mozku, které mohou dále vést k léčebným účinkům na kognitivní funkce.
Projekt C: Parkinsonova nemoc (PN) je onemocnění, které souvisí primárně s úbytkem dopaminergních neuronů v substantia nigra. U více než poloviny pacientů s PN se časem rozvine mírná kognitivní porucha (MKP-PN). Tito pacienti mají vyšší riziko demence. PN je nevyléčitelná, lze ale potlačit příznaky a zpomalit její rozvoj. V současné době chybí časný specifický neurozobrazovací biomarker pro PN. Animální studie ukazují potenciál difusního kurtozního zobrazování (DKI). DKI je vhodné pro hodnocení mikrostrukturních změn, např. patologického hromadění proteinů. Nalezení specifického, časného a neinvazivního markeru PN by umožnilo včasnou diagnostiku, zahájení léčby a zlepšení kvality života pacientů.";CZ;;Academic

Do skupiny primárních intrakraniálních tumorů jsou mimo jiné řazeny nejprevalentnější primární nádory mozku - gliální tumory a nejčastější primární tumory plen mozkových - meningeomy. V našich předchozích projektech jsme sledovali různé histopatologické parametry (celularitu, vaskularitu, proliferační potenciál) u glioblastomu, který je ze skupiny primárních intrakraniálních tumorů nejčastější high grade tumor. Tyto parametry jsme korelovali s parametry na MR (ADC) a zjistili jsme, že na základě hodnot ADC je možné predikovat histologickou povahu nádoru a rozsah infiltrace. V pokračování našeho projektu máme v plánu rozšířit analýzu o další parametry tumoru dle MR, například o hodnocení poměru rozsahu nekrózy a postkontrastně se sytícího lemu, či volumometrii a korelování s histologickým hodnoceným poměrem nekrózy s viabilním nádorovou tkání a jejich vztáhnutí ke klinickým údajům o přežívání a času do progrese onemocnění. Plánujeme se dále zaměřit i na jiné primární tumory mozku, především low-grade gliální tumory a meningeomy. V retrospektivní části analýzy pak budeme zkoumat možnost predikce recidivy gliálních nádorů na základě zobrazovacích metod, případně histologických charakteristik.

Dále rozvíjí a navazuje na projekt 1586/2018 a další projekty podobného zaměření řešené v minulých letech (metronomická a antiangiogenní léčba, individualizovaná terapie). Projekt je v souladu s nejmodernějšími trendy současné onkologie tj. personalizované léčby či „precision oncology“.  Postupy personalizované léčby jsou založeny na podrobném vyšetření konkrétního onemocnění, jeho vývoji v čase (opakované biopsie a biologická analýza) i genetického pozadí pacienta. K tomuto účelu se využívají jak komerčně dostupné, tak „in-house“ akademické postupy založené na molekulárně biologických technologiích. Data jsou podrobena sofistikované bioinformatické analýze, která tvoří neoddělitelnou součást těchto tzv. theranostických přístupů.   V rámci tohoto principu provádíme analýzy biologického materiálu, které zahrnují transkripční profilování, detekce fosforylace receptorových tyrosinkináz a MAP kináz proteomickými metodami a sekvenování nové generace NGS  (whole exome/genome sequencing), detekci specifických translokací/genových fúzí (RNAseq). Panel vyšetření byl v roce 2019 rozšířen o sekvenování metylomu. Koncem tohoto roku je v plánu také zahájení testování vyšetřování mutací cell free DNA z plazmy pacienta.  Získané komplexní informace jsou hodnoceny v rámci pravidelných odborných setkání – tzv. expertního panelu („molecular tumor boardu“), na základě kterého je vydáno konkrétní léčebné doporučení. Dlouhodobým cílem je zlepšení léčebných výsledků u pacientů s vysoce rizikovým nádorovým onemocněním jako jsou děti s refrakterními a relabujícími solidními nádory a non-Hodgkinskými lymfomy (NHL). Toho je možné dosáhnout právě personalizovanými postupy v rámci theranostického principu, jak dokladují naše publikované výsledky. Na základě našich zkušeností je možné personalizovaný léčebný princip aplikovat cca u 60% uvažovaných pacientů. Cílem projektu je komplexní rozvoj theranostického principu a jeho aplikaci u dětí s vysoce rizikovým nádorovým onemocněním a zlepšovat tak úspěšnost léčby. Důraz je kladen také na opakované vyšetření nádorové tkáně téhož pacienta (opakované biopsie při recidivách/progresích, klonální vývoj) a sleduje nejmodernější trendy v onkologii (postupy jako tzv. „liquid dynamic medicine“ a „N-of-1 clinical trials“).;CZ;;Academic

Cílem projektu je stanovení parametrů plicní cirkulace pomocí CMR - především Pulmonary Blood Volume a Pulmonary Transit Beats u kardiologických pacientů a určit jejich prospektivní hodnotu.

2) DKMP je nejčastější diagnózou, pro kterou je prováděna srdeční transplantace. Zejména v případech čerstvého záchytu však u 30-50% nemocných může dojít k úpravě funkce levé komory. To je spojeno s příznivou prognózou. Hledání markerů reverzní remodelace levé komory má proto zásadní význam pro prognostickou stratifikaci DKMP.

3) Současná diagnostika srdečních arytmií probíhá v prvé řadě za pomoci standardního 12 svodového EKG záznamu. Doplňující, a neméně důležitou, součástí diagnostiky je i zkoumání intrakardiálních signálů při vlastním elektrofyziologickém vyšetření umožňující přesně identifikovat místo vzniku arytmie v srdeční svalovině. V současné době probíhá analýza intrakardiálních signálů pouze v časové oblasti, tzn. rozměřování a porovnávání signálů, tvorba „local activation time“ map apod.. Analýza signálu ve spektrální oblasti se tedy nabízí jako další možná metoda, kterou lze efektivně diagnostikovat arytmie jak typu „re-entry“, tak především arytmie fokálního charakteru.";CZ;;Academic

Minimalizace invazivity operací je jasný trend a procento operací provedeno endoskopicky, miniinvazivně, dramaticky stoupá. Naproti klasické operativě rukami chirurga je ale pohyblivost endoskopických nástrojů zatím omezená. To při dlouhé a složité operaci může vést k technickým limitacím proveditelnosti některých úkonů nutných pro zdárné dokončení operace endoskopicky. Přínos v endoskopické operativě přinesly robotické systémy, které pomocí počítačových algoritmů převádějí pohyb rukou chirurga na velmi pohyblivé nástroje. Tyto velmi precizní systémy jsou ale finančně velmi náročné a to jak jejich pořízení, tak i následné provozní náklady. Pokrok v současné technice již ale dovoluje miniaturizaci nástrojů a proto vznikají komerčně dostupné robotizované nástroje, které drží operatér v ruce a přímo ovládá jejich robotizovaný pohyb svými prsty. Tyto systémy jsou jednoduché na používání, cenově dostupně s minimálními provozními náklady a oproti robotickému systému i kompaktní. Proto jejich zavedení na naší klinice považujeme za výsadu v České Republice a plánujeme rozšířit jejich zavedení do běžné operativy i pro mladé chirurgy, hledat jejich co možná nejširší využití v denní praxi a spolupracovat s technologickými firmami na jejich zdokonalování.;CZ;;academic, student

Stav flow považuje Csikszentmihalyi (1996) za nejlepší okamžiky našich životů, což jsou podle něj ""ty, kdy se naše tělo nebo mysl vzepne k hranicím svých možností ve vědomé snaze dosáhnout něčeho obtížného, co stojí za to.” Je významně spojen se sportovním odvětvím, nicméně bylo doposud na tomto poli zkoumáno pouze pomocí psychologických ‚měkkých‘ technik. Je přitom zřejmé, že pro jeho dosahování jsou charakteristické i biochemické a fyziologické ukazovatele. Holistický pohled na zkoumaný stav si klade za cíl právě tento projekt.

Do studie bude přijato 60 probandů. Všichni budou testování pomocí diagnostického nástroje pro flow DFS-2 (osobnostní dispozice ke stavu flow) a FFS-2 (subjektivní vnímání aktuálního flow).
V rámci psychologických aspektů budou testovány osobnostní charakteristiky sportovců a subjektivně vnímaná míra psychologického stresu. Projekt nabízí možnost propojení biochemických, fyziologických a psychologických korelátů stresu a porovnání míry zátěže prostřednictvím objektivních metod a vlastního sebeposouzení sportovců. K měření osobnostních charakteristik bude použita metoda Big Five Inventory BFI-44. Subjektivně vnímaná míra stresu bude měřena českou verzí Škály vnímaného stresu PSS-10, která představuje zkrácenou verzi metody Perceived Stress Scale. Oba faktory – osobnost a vnímaná míra stresu -  budou  rovněž přezkoumány ve vztahu k  fenoménu flow.
Jako objektivní metoda stanovení stresu bude využita analýza kortizolu z matrice vlasu. Koncentrace kortizolu ve vlasech (HCC) vykazuje spojení s velkým počtem stavů somatického a duševního zdraví, včetně fyzických stresorů, jako je vytrvalostní cvičení. Pomocí HCC bude u participantů retrospektivně zhodnocena míra zátěže za uplynulých 6 měsíců. Aktuální stav bude vyšetřen na základě stanovení variability srdcového rytmu, jako indikátoru psychického stresu a doplněn měřením míry oxidačního stresu.

Schopnost dosahovat stav flow bude korelována s výstupy psychických, biochemických a fyziologických měření. Zhodnoceny budou osobnostní předpoklady a také možnost nastavení lepší stratifikace tréninku vzhledem k měřeným parametrům.";CZ;;Academic

90377;1241/2019;Use of Oxygen Reserve Index in anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine;Helán Martin, MUDr. Ph.D.;55111;Implemented by;01.01.2020;31.12.2020;Recipient;MU / GA MU / Category A - Student research projects;LF;Anaesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic;Oxygen reserve index (ORi) je nová neinvazivní metoda hodnocení oxygenace pacientů. Jedná se o prstové čidlo, podobné jako k měření pulsní oxymetrie (SpO2). Oproti SpO2 ale podává informaci o určité „kyslíkové rezervě“, čili o úrovni hyperoxie. Hodnota ORI koreluje s hodnotou paO2 získanou pomocí analýzy krevních plynů. V anesteziologii je žádoucí navodit určitou míru hyperoxie před úvodem do CA a rutinně se provádí formou tzv. preoxygenace. Empiricky je známo, že některé skupiny pacientů (plicní patologie, obezita) vyžadují jinou formu preoxygenace, např.: preoxygenaci těsnící maskou, delší čas preoxygenace, vyšší průtok vdechované směsi, použití neinvazivní ventilace (NIV) atd. Kontinuálně měřená hodnota ORI by mohla kvantifikovat a optimalizovat postup preoxygenace u různých pacientů. Naopak v intenzivní péči je hyperoxie považována za nežádoucí. U pacientů s nutností oxygenoterapie nebo umělé plicní ventilace, proto kontrolujeme úroveň hyperoxie pomocí analýzy krevních plynů (astrup). Předpokládáme, že kontinuální měření ORI by nám umožňovalo pružněji reagovat na přítomnost hyperoxie u pacientů a tedy rychleji upravit míru podávané oxygenoterapie a tím i omezit množství krevních odběrů (na astrup) u pacientů na JIP.;CZ;;

Zároveň aplikace  technologií přináší i značná sociální a uživatelská rizika. Projekt si klade za cíl analyzovat jak kontext vývoje a podmínek co nejvhodnější aplikace těchto pomůcek, tak také sociologicky popsat možná úskalí zneužití a míru nevyžádané sociální kontroly v prostředí současné personalizované a komercializované medicíny. Z hlediska sociologie je nutné věnovat velkou pozornost procesům aplikace nových technologií a zařízení, včetně etických otázek. Projekt řeší témata autonomie a rozhodování o správném postupu zvládání života s neurokognitivním deficitem s novými technickými zařízeními a také  téma nerovných možností příjemců a poskytovatelů péče spolupodílet se na strategii vlastní léčby, což je v českém kontextu dosud málo reflektováno. Projekt je zaměřen na sociologickou analýzu každodenního života pacientů s Alzheimerovou chorobou a na identifikaci typů technologických pomůcek pro pacienty, které jednak jim samotným pomohou mít svou nemoc pod kontrolou a jednak jen minimálně zasáhnou do jejich osobní autonomie a tělesné integrity při jejich používání. Zaměří se též na minimalizaci sociálního stigmatu viditelných asistenčních a kompenzačních pomůcek.

V přechozích obdobích byly vytvářeny a implementovány doporučené postupy v péči o osoby s nehojící se ránou. Proveden byl rozsáhlý průzkum zaměřený na proces hodnocení nehojících se ran v klinické praxi (u poskytovatelů akutní lůžkové péče, domácí péče a pracovišť sociálních služeb). Následně byly hodnoceny příčiny vzniku sororigenních ran a psychometrické vlastnosti škál pro hodnocení rizika vzniku tlakových lézí. Z předchozích projektů vyplynuly nedostatky v hodnocení nehojících se ran i v nedostatečné erudici zdravotnických pracovníků v přímé péči v managementu ran a jejich identifikaci.

Hlavním cílem předkládaného projektu je studium změn ve strukturách centrální nervové soustavy (CNS) v reakci na poškození periferního nervu traumatem nebo chemoterapeutiky, traumatické poranění míchy a subarachnoidální krvácení. 
Navrhovaný projekt je založen na experimentech prováděných v rámci témat dizertačních prací studentů postgraduálního studia. Konkrétně se jedná o studium inflamačních procesů v ganglion trigeminale a subnucleus caudalis po poškození nervus trigeminus, studium aktivace gliových buněk a šíření neurozánětu v CNS doprovázející neuropatickou bolest a potlačení zánětlivých procesů v nervové soustavě po chemoterapeutiky indukované periferní neuropatii. Dalšími tématy jsou aktivace a modulace gliových buněk v supraspinálních strukturách po poškození míchy a reakce mozkových bariér na subarachnoidální krvácení.
Výsledky navrhovaného projektu přispějí k pochopení patofyziologie procesů v CNS a možnosti jejich potlačení v reakci na traumatické nebo chemoterapeutiky indukovaném poškození nervu, traumatické poškození míchy a subarachnoidální krvácení.";CZ;;Academic

Simulační scénáře s tématikou emergentní péče mohou být užitečným nástrojem k tomu, aby si účastníci simulace zvykli činit rychlá             a správná klinická rozhodnutí, byli schopni si vybudovat myšlenkové vzorce diferenciální diagnostiky a kritického uvažování, získali orientaci ve stresových situacích, naučili se kooperovat a komunikovat v rámci mezioborového týmu             a zároveň simulační scénář umožňuje poskytnout okamžitou zpětnou vazby k výkonům participantů. Model učení dospělých zdůrazňuje, že profitují zejména právě z osobní zkušeností (hands-on experience), cíleného procvičování (deliberate practice) teoretických znalostí a správně podané zpětné vazby. Přestože nemůže simulace nahradit zkušenosti z klinické praxe, může být výborným nástrojem pro získávání zkušeností bez ohrožení bezpečnosti pacientů.Medicínské chyby a faktory suboptimální péče, zjištěné v rámci simulačních scénářů postgraduálních účastníků, mají  repetitivní charakter a lze je použít jako sledované učební výstupy pro pregraduální klinickou výuku.;CZ;;academic, student

Navrhovaný model unikátním způsobem modeluje časná „presymptomatická“ stádia PD, čímž poskytuje nástroj pro studium časných diagnostických ukazatelů PD a pro budoucí vývoj inovativních chorobu modifikujících („disease modifying“) léčiv, např. neuroprotektivních. Součástí projektu je i hodnocení jednoho kandidátního léčiva tohoto typu (baicalein, flavonoid šišáku bajkalského, Scutellaria baicalensis).
Expozice pesticidům je klinicky asociována s pozdějším rozvojem idiopatické PD. Navrhovaný myší model proto spočívá v intranazální aplikaci pesticidu rotenonu a vychází z dobře klinicky i preklinicky dokladovaného předpokladu, že patologický proces začíná v periferním nervovém systému a postupně progreduje až do bazálních ganglií. Rotenonový model založený na dlouhodobé intragastrické aplikaci velmi malých dávek byl již úspěšně validován. Tento projekt navrhuje model založený na klinicky relevantnější intranazální expozici tomuto environmentálnímu toxinu.
Projekt využívá tří základních metodických přístupů – behaviorálního testování PD-podobného fenotypu, zobrazování parametrů difúze molekul tkáně vody (zejména kurtózy dufúze, DKI) pomocí magnetické rezonance (MRI) a imunohistochemického potvrzení patologických procesů. Zobrazování kurtózy difúze je hlavním datovým výstupem projektu, jehož výsledky jsou snadno přenositelné i do klinické praxe, neboť se jedná o neinvazivní metodu.

Předpokládaným patologickým mechanismem AEA je zánět zprostředkovaný Th2 lymfocyty a mimo jiné také snížená funkce indukovaných T-regulačních buněk (iTreg) produkujících IL-10 a zvýšené koncentraci gelatinázy B (MMP9) v séru. iTreg vznikají při aktivaci CD4+ T lymfocytů, která je ovlivňována také intracelulárním komplementem. Farmakologicky je možné další ovlivnění této aktivace vitamínem D. Projekt je zaměřen na sledování receptorů CD46, dále C3aR, C5aR u iTreg, jejich ovlivnění prostřednictvím vitamínu D in vitro u nemocných s AEA. Pomocí kultivačních pokusů bude sledována také produkce IL-10 iTreg získaných stimulací anti-CD3 + anti-CD46, dále bude sledována produkce MMP9 v supernatantech stimulovaných buněk. Zvýšená koncentrace MMP9 snižuje expresi CD46 a tím i aktivitu iTreg spolu s produkcí IL-10. Vitamín D naopak produkci IL-10 zvyšuje a obnovuje funkce iTreg, což by mohlo vést u pacientů s AEA ke zmírnění reaktivity imunitního systému.;CZ;;Academic

Postižení periferního motorického neuronu se projevuje areflexií, svalovými hypotrofiemi, hypotonií, fascikulacemi nebo fibrilacemi.
SMN má rozhodující roli v zpracování RNA a to tím, že přímo váže proteiny důležité pro správnou tvorbu a funkci miRNA. V případě míšních motoneuronů je miRNA zásadní pro vývoj, diferenciaci, rast axonů, cytoskeletální struktury, tvorbu synapsí a celkové aktivity. Micro-RNA je klíčovým elementem správné funkce a přežití motoneuronů. Dysregulace zpracování RNA a exprese micro-RNA jsou hlavními mechanizmy, které se podílejí na vzniku onemocnění motoneuronu. Objevuje se stále více důkazů, že určité specifické miRNA vedou k selektivní vulnerabilitě motoneuronů u SMA.

Jedná se o skupinu onemocnění, jejichž průběh je značně heterogenní, s celým spektrem projevů a s variabilní mírou agresivity nemoci. Velkou výzvou je časná diagnostika pacientů s potenciálně závažnou formou IBD. Přestože jsou k dispozici kritéria pro odhad nepříznivé prognózy pacientů, tak nejsou dostatečná pro spolehlivý a přesný odhad vývoje onemocnění či léčebné odpovědi. U některých pacientů s nepříznivými prognostickými faktory nakonec nedochází k rozvoji závažných symptomů, zatím co u pacientů s původně příznivým výhledem může být situace opačná. Poptávka po přesných a neinvazivních biomarkerech je vysoká, jelikož by mohly napomoci rychlejší, jednodušší a efektivnější charakterizaci pacientů a personalizovanému léčebnému postupu.V nedávné době byly popsány v patogenezi mnoha onemocnění epigenetické a regulační mechanizmy, zejména pak úloha krátkých nekódujících RNA ( mikroRNA). Tyto molekuly byly studovány jako potenciální biomarkery pro své jedinečné vlastnosti, jelikož jsou lehce detekovatelné ve tkáních i tělních tekutinách, jsou vysoce tkáňově i časově specifické a jejich hladiny jsou měřitelné zavedenými laboratorními technikami. Bylo prokázáno, že některé miRNA jsou asociované s ileální a kolonickou Crohnovou chorobou u dospělých pacientů, nebo jsou schopné odlišit pacienty s ulcerózní kolitidou od pacientů s Crohnovou chorobou, přesto ale jejich role a funkce jak u dospělých, tak u dětských pacientů s IBD  není stále dostatečně prozkoumána. Naše studie se zaměřuje na globální profilování miRNA u dětských pacientů s IBD a následné srovnávání expresních profilů u různých podskupin těchto pacientů, a to jak s odlišnou diagnózou (ulcerózní kolitida a Crohnova choroba), tak s různě závažným průběhem vlastního onemocnění,či odpovědí na léčbu. Cílem je vytvoření diagnostických, prognostických či prediktivních panelů miRNA, pomocí kterých by bylo možné včasně diagnostikovat pacienty s horší prognózou či léčebnou odpovědí, na druhé straně zbytečně nezatěžovat pacienty s prognosticky příznivější formou IBD nadbytečnou léčbou s množstvím potenciálních nežádoucích účinků.

Incidence a prevalence FS se neustále mírně zvyšuje z důvodu prodlužující se délky života, vyšší úspěšnosti léčby srdečních onemocnění, ale taktéž z důvodu vyšší incidence obezity a dalších metabolických rizikových faktorů, asociovaných s výskytem FS.  FS je spojena s vyšší morbiditou a mortalitou, danou zejména srdečním selháním a cévní příhodou mozkovou. Katetrizační ablace, spočívající v izolaci plicních žil, představuje v současné době nejúčinnější léčebnou metodu léčby FS.  Z observačních studií se ukazuje, že výrazná intervence zacílená na rizikové faktory FS, jako je redukce hmotnosti, příjmu alkoholu a vyšší pohybová aktivita je spojena taktéž s výrazně vyšším udržením sinusového rytmu (SR).

Ve zvýšené míře vyskytují zejména u plegických pacientů. Chirurgická léčba dekubitů je sice zdlouhavá, ale ve vysokém procentu vede ke zhojení tohoto typu chronické rány. Operačnímu uzávěru dekubitu předchází pečlivá nekrektomie (kompletní odstranění všech avitálních tkání z rány) s exstirpací pseudocysty dekubitu, která je prováděna chirurgicky. Nové technologie jako např. Versajet (nekrektomie pomocí vodní trysky) otevírají nové možnosti chirurgické přípravy rány před jejím operačním uzávěrem. U chronických ran dochází v procesu hojení k prodloužení zánětlivé fáze a hojení proto nepostupuje do další fáze. Jedním z mnoha faktorů uplatňujících se ve fázi zánětu jsou parametry oxidativního stresu - reaktivní formy kyslíku a dusíku. Cílem projektu je posoudit přínosy méně invazivního přístupu při nekrektomii s využitím Versajet, než při klasické chirurgické nekrektomii ve vztahu k dynamice reaktivních forem kyslíku, dusíku a markerů zánětu.;CZ;;Academic

Zdá se pravděpodobné, že v rozporu s v současné době platnými doporučenými postupy, by pro pokles mortality díky moderní farmakologické terapii srdečního selhání mělo být možno identifikovat skupinu pacientů, u kterých nebude přínos ICD dostatečný, aby ospravedlnil jeho implantaci. 
Design studie: multicentrická, prospektivní, randomizovaná, kontrolovaná studie hodnotící přínos implantace CRT-P vs. CRT-D u pacientů s dilatační kardiomyopatií, EFLK <35% při optimální farmakoterapii včetně nejmodernějších léků s vyloučením pacientů s významným rozsahem fibrózy myokardu na magnetické rezonanci.
Primární end-point: čas do úmrtí z jakékoliv příčiny
Sekundární end-point: náhlá srdeční smrt, kardiovaskulární smrt, úspěšná resuscitace pro zástavu oběhu či komorovou tachyarytmii, komplikace spojené s implantací přístroje, změna v kvalitě života
Průběh studie: Po optimalizaci farmakoterapie srdečního selhání randomizace 1:1 na implantaci CRT-P a CRT-D.
Předkládáme protokol plánované randomizované, kontrolované studie hodnotící přínos implantace CRT-P a CRT-D u pacientů s dilatační kardiomyopatií a srdečním selháním. Důvodem, proč jsme navrhli tuto klinickou studii, je nedostatek důkazů pro léčbu této významné skupiny pacientů (1 z 2500 dospělých). Jejich mortalita zůstává stále zhruba 20% i přes recentní pokroky v léčbě. Na základě aktuálně dostupné evidence není díky významnému snížení mortality moderní farmakoterapií srdečního selhání zcela jasné, kteří pacienti by měli mít implantován ICD. Naše hypotéza je, že pacienti se symptomatickým srdečním selháním s LVEF ?35%, bez významného rozsahu fibrózy myokardu na magnetické rezonanci, nebudou z implantace CRT-D profitovat více než pacienti z implantace CRT-P.

Optimalizovaný produkt bude dále testován na animálním modelu (prase bílé) s vytvořením parciálních kožních defektů (simulace donorských míst a také povrchních popálenin s prezentovanou nekrotickou tkání). 
Základním cílem projektu bude vytvořit konkurenceschopný biologický kryt, který bude svou aktivitou pozitivně ovlivňovat uzávěr kožních defektů. Dále bude cílem vytvořit také materiál, který bude mít potenciál pro použití jako tzv.

Tento typ degenerativního postižení je diagnostikován u stále většího počtu a současně se  toto postižení objevuje u mladších osob s vysokými nároky na zatížení pohybového aparátu a rychlý návrat k původní aktivitám a výkonosti.
U středně pokročilých stádií gonartrózy máme k dispozici dvě léčebné metody formou chirurgického zákroku: valgizační osteotomie tibie a unikompartmentální endoprotetickou náhradu. Metody se od sebe liší již vlastní filozofií přístupu k postiženému kloubu. V případě valgizační osteotomie tibie (HTO, high tibial osteotomy) je principem změnit osu končetiny takovým způsobem, aby původně přetížená číst kolenního kloubu byla odlehčena a zátěž se přenesla na zevní stranu kolene. Druhou metodou je náhrada části kolenního kloubu unikompartmentální, částečnou endoprotézou (UKA, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty). 
Naplnění smyslu projektu bude provedeno prostřednictvím časosběrného (předoperačního a pooperačního) hodnocení změn kinematických a dynamických projevů chůze (3D kinematická analýza, síla v kloubech), rozložení plantárních tlaků na chodidlech (podobarografická plošina Emed) a hodnocení izokinetické svalové síly kolenního a kyčelního kloubu (izokinetická dynamometrie). Dále bude provedeno subjektivní hodnocení bolestivosti a samoobslužnosti (dotazník).

Analýza těchto dat bude mít za úkol odhalit přetížení zbylých segmentů pohybového aparátu.

K ochraně genomové stability mají hPSC zvýšenou aktivitu bázově excizního opravného mechanizmu (BER) a homologní rekombinace (HR), zatímco aktivity nehomologního a alternativního spojování konců DNA jsou konstantní. Náš výzkum ukázal, že oxidativní poškození bází je konvertováno na dvojřetězcové zlomy aktivitou BER a následně bezchybně opraveno rychlým spojováním konců, zatímco pluripotenční geny spolupracují na ochraně konců DNA před resekcí. Naší hypotézou je, že zlomy asociované s replikačním stresem u adaptovných buněk, se málo aktivním BER, jsou opravovány stejným opravným mechanimem spojování konců.

Tyto metody umožní získat nové poznatky o morfologických parametrech buněk a jejich interakcích s 2D a 3D porézními biomateriály jako potenciálními nosiči buněk. Navržené experimenty jsou založeny na kompozitech vyrobených z buněčných typů, které jsou klíčovými složkami plic (epiteliální buňky dýchacích cest, endotelové buňky a stromální buňky), začleněných do různých typů nosičů. Tento model plicní tkáně umožní optimalizaci parametrů spojených s buňkami a materiálem (počet buněk, délka kultivace, porozita materiálu, typ buněk) a poskytne bezkonkurenční příležitost pro optimalizaci postupů zobrazovací metody (kontrastování, skenovacích algoritmů, modelování). Tímto způsobem budeme nejen schopni maximalizovat možnosti vizualizace buněčných struktur pomocí výpočetní tomografie, ale získáme současně nové informace o chování inženýrovaných plicních tkání využitelných v biomedicíně.;CZ;;Academic

Detekce světla vyzářeného je podstatou využití těchto látek v experimentech. Navíc světlo emitované fluorescenční látkou je viditelné jenom při použití speciální kamery, takže neobarvuje tkáně a neztrácí se tak přehlednost operačního pole. Viditelnost tkání obarvených pomocí ICG závisí na místě podání. Intravenózní podání zajistí distribuci do všech vitálních tkání, kam proudí krev. ICG se při aplikaci do tukové tkáně síří tukovými a lymfatickými cestami do okolí. Vzhledem k embryologickému původu perirektální tukové tkáně je tato tkáň od okolních struktur ostře ohraničena a nedochází k distribuci ICG mimo tuto tkáň. ICG je taktéž po podání intravenózně vylučováno játry do žluče a tudíž zviditelní žlučový strom.

Hlavní překážka v efektivní léčbě glioblastomu je jeho invazivní růst do peritumorózní mozkové tkáně limitující efekt resekce a jeho intratumorózní biologická heterogenita oslabující léčebný efekt terapie onkologické. Reziduální onemocnění v peritumorózní mozkové zóně je léčeno onkologicky na základě analýzy tkáně masy tumoru, která byla odstraněna při operaci. S ohledem na vysokou intratumorózní heterogenitu si ovšem nemůžeme být jisti, že charakteristika reziduálního onemocnění je stejná, jaká byla popsána ve tkáni získané operací. Tento fakt může zodpovídat za selhání dosavadních snah o cílenou biologickou léčbu u GBM. V první fázi našeho projektu jsme odebrané vzorky topizovaně zpracovali a určili významné histopatologické vlastnosti (celularita, proliferační index, vaskulární denzita) a expresi EGFR. Tyto vlastnosti byly selektivně hodnoceny v tumorózní, peritumorózní a zdravé tkáni, subklasifikované dle exprese proteinu nestin. První výsledky prezentované v “Pilotní studie: selektivní biopsie u high grade gliálních neoplázií mozku“ podporují naši hypotézu o intratumorózní heterogenitě.

Lepší pochopení reziduálního onemocnění v peritumorózní mozkové zóně je kritické pro odhalení mechanizmů zodpovědných za recidivu glioblastomu s cílem optimalizoval chirurgickou resekci a vyvinout nové terapeutické postupy.";CZ;;Academic

Projekt A:
Déjà vu je anomální paměťový fenomén, při kterém dochází k neadekvátnímu pocitu familiarity nově zažívané situace. Vyskytuje se u většiny zdravé populace, ale i jako doprovodný jev meziotemporální epilepsie a schizofrenie. V těchto onemocněních dominují změny excitability mozkové kůry (KE) a strukturní změny v oblasti hipokampu. Podobný vzorec strukturních a metabolomických změn v temporálních lalocích byl v našich předešlých studiích identifikován i u zdravých jedinců zažívajících déjà vu. Předkládaný projekt má za úkol rozšířit poznatky o roli KE v genezi déjà vu u zdravých jedinců přímým měřením elektrofyziologické aktivity kortexu prostřednictvím EEG a simultánního TMS-EEG (transkraniální evokované potenciály) v reakci na vizuální stimulaci (Pattern glare task, který nově uvádíme do českého prostředí). Získané poznatky povedou k lepšímu pochopení excitační rovnováhy a její roli v paměťových anomáliích u zdravých jedinců i pacientů s některými neurologickými onemocněními.  

Projekt B:
Alzheimerova nemoc (AN) je nejčastější příčina demence ve stárnoucí populaci, její incidence vzrůstá s věkem a ve věku nad 85 let trpí AN téměř polovina populace. Onemocnění je charakterizováno poruchou krátkodobé epizodické paměti, ale již v časném stádiu onemocnění, tj. mírné kognitivní poruchy (MPK-AN) dochází rovněž k poruše zrakové pozornosti a zrakově-prostorových funkcí. Demence při AN má negativní dopad na soběstačnost pacienta, sociální a pracovní zařazení, kvalitu života pacienta i pečovatele a je spojena s významným zvýšením morbidity/mortality. V projektu budeme zkoumat neurální koreláty paměťových poruch hodnocených testem asociačního učení u pacientů s MKP-AN. Multimodální zobrazování mozku pomocí magnetické rezonance (MRI) v kombinaci s neinvazivní mozkovou stimulací (NIMS), jakou je repetitivní transkraniální magnetická stimulace (rTMS), slouží jako další nástroj pro odhalení patofyziologických mechanismů kognitivních a behaviorálních symptomů. Navíc pomocí NIMS můžeme navodit změny plasticity a funkce mozku, které mohou dále vést k potenciálně léčebným účinkům na kognitivní funkce.";CZ;;employee, academic

U většiny chlapců s MD se rozvine dilatační kardiomyopatie (DKMP). U žen - přenašeček  tohle genu dochází pravděpodobně sekundárním následkem myokardiální fibrózy k rozvoji DKMP přičemž samotné onemocnění srdce se objevuje mnohem dřív, než dochází k manifestaci prvních kardiologických příznaků.
 Nedávné studie naznačují, že nosičky Duchennové/Beckerové muskulární dystrofie (DMD/BMD) mají stejné fibrosní vzorce jako muži klinicky zívne postižení danou nemoci, výskyt kterých stoupá s věkem.   
Magnetická rezonance srdce (CMR) je moderní, neinvazivní diagnostická a vysoko reprodukovatelná technika na hodnocení objemů a funkce levé a pravé komory, pomocí které je možné hodnotit časné kardiologické příznaky, před rozvojem manifestního srdečního selhání např. hodnocením deformace myokardu (strainu) levé komory. Strainy LK lze hodnotit například pomocí techniky tzv. feature trackingu, kdy lze hodnotit globální i regionální deformace myokardu ve 3 základních směrech – longitudinální, cirkumferenciální a radiální deformace.

Současně je nutno brát zřetel na narůstající počet nemocných s poruchou paměti a rizikem chyb v užívání medikace. Časná diagnostika poruch paměti toto riziko významně sníží. Nově se objevující druhy léčiv s sebou sice přinášejí naději na úspěšnější řešení různých chorobných stavů, klinická zkoušení léků však často pacienty vyššího věku multimorbidní a se sníženou soběstačnosti nezahrnují. Proto je důležité věnovat pozornost případným novým komplikacím spojeným se zavedením nového léčiva - v poslední době konkrétně skupiny nových orálních antikoagulancií. Nadále bude věnována pozornost preventivním aktivitám podporujícím úspěšné stárnutí a předcházejícím ztrátě soběstačnosti seniorů. U hospitalizovaných nemocných bude věnována pozornost rychlosti návratu míry soběstačnosti seniora v závislosti na intenzitě rehabilitace.

Většina (80%) pacientů je diagnostikována ve stádiu lokálně pokročilého nebo metastatického onemocnění. Minorita nemocných indikovaných k resekčnímu výkonu podstupuje náročný operační výkon s významným rizikem perioperačních komplikací. Přestože je resekce považována za jedinou potenciálně kurativní metodu, není přínos chirurgické intervence u všech pacientů stejný. Jedním z možných vysvětlení horší prognózy některých z nich je uvažována diseminace nádoru - přítomnost mikrometastáz, které jsou pod rozlišovací schopností zobrazovacích metod a nejsou patrné ani makroskopicky při operaci. Vzhledem k současnému širokému užití Indocyaninové zeleně (ICG) se nabízí možnost užití tohoto fluoroforu k zobrazení pouhým okem neparných metastáz nádoru na površích orgánů dutiny břišní a na pobřišnici. V projektu bude využito skutečnosti, že karcinom pankreatu produkuje specifický protein (CA 19-9), který exprimuje na svém povrchu a rovněž uvolňuje do krevního oběhu. Jedná se o nádorový marker standardně využívaný v klinické praxi. Projekt bude probíhat ve třech na sebe navazujících fázích: 1. Konjugace ICG s vhodnou protilátkou proti CA 19-9. 2.

Úvod a odborná charakteristika:
Videolaryngoskopie je doporučena jako možná metoda k zlepšení vizualizace hlasových vazů v případě obtížné intubace a selhání prvního intubačního pokusu. Data srovnávající videolaryngoskopii s přímou laryngoskopii vzhledem na úspěšnost a rychlost zajištění dýchacích cest tracheální kanylou jsou kontroverzní (urgentní příjem, intenzivní péče, elektivní zajištění na anestezii). Videolaryngoskopie poskytuje aditivní data obzvláště u tzv. difficult airway, u kterých jsou hlasové vazy obtížně identifikovatelné.
Hypotéza:
Videolaryngoskopie vede k vyšší úspěšnosti prvního intubačního pokusu, k redukci času od inciace intubace k úspěšnému zajištění dýchacích cest, k redukci nutnosti manuálního prodýchávání, redukci Cormack-Lehane skóre 
Design: prospektivní randomizovaná studie
Popis studie:
Studie je designovaná jako prospektivní randomizovaná studie – randomizace proběhne pomocí permutační blokové randomizace – v dikci IBA LF. Po schválení etickou komisí FN Brno a registraci studie na clinicaltrials.gov bude probíhat zařazování do studie. Pacientům/zákonným zástupcům splňujícím inclusion kritéria budu vysvětlen význam a průběh studie na anesteziologické ambulanci, event. během předanestetického vyšetření – podepsání informovaného souhlasu s účastí ve studii. Po zařazení do studie, bude odslepena randomizační obálka (pořadí obálek a zaslepení – IBA LF) a pacienti budou následně zařazeni do intervenční skupiny (intubace videolryngockopem C-MAC®) a kontrolní skupiny – přímá laryngoskopie (Macintosh event. Miller lžíce dle věku a váhy pacienta). Indukce do anestezie bude probíhat standardně dle zvyklostí pracoviště a lékaře (pragmatická studie). Bude sledován čas do úspěšné intubace (od rozhodnutí zahájit intubaci při dostatečně hluboké anestezii – vymizení víčkového reflexu, nástup automatického dýchání při inhalačním úvodu, event. nástup apnoe a nástup svalové relaxace), intubační podmínky (Cormack-Lehane skóre) a úspěšnost prvního intubačního pokusu.";CZ;;Academic

Mají většinou rychlý a agresivní průběh a ovlivňují tak život nejen pacienta, ale i jeho okolí. Nejdůležitějším cílem péče o tyto jedince je tedy pokud možno úplné vyléčení nemoci (je-li to možné), nebo alespoň dosažení dlouhodobé remise, aby se pacient mohl vrátit zpět do běžného života. 
Nutné je proto nejen včasné rozpoznání onemocnění, ale také jeho přesná diagnostika a podání kvalitní terapie. Velkým příslibem je zavádění tzv. personalizované medicíny, která umožňuje pacientovi upravit léčbu podle jeho potřeb včetně snížení nežádoucích účinků na minimum, přičemž komplexně posuzuje různé faktory ovlivňující působení dané terapie. 
Součástí léčby bývají velmi často infekční komplikace – řadí se dokonce k častější příčině úmrtí než choroba samotná. Aby tedy nedošlo k bezprostřednímu ohrožení života nemocného, je nevyhnutelné včas a správně rozpoznat původce infekce a začít s vhodnou a účinnou léčbou.

Významnými profesemi jsou tzv. pomáhající profese, které směřují k podpoře rozvoje osobnosti člověka (jeho vzdělanosti, zdraví, psychické i fyzické kondici). Vysoká míra odbornosti profesního výkonu je zajišťována mj. díky provázanosti profesí s disciplínami pěstovanými na univerzitách – spojnicí je přitom přípravné (pregraduální) a další (celoživotní) vzdělávání profesionálů. V dynamice měnících se podmínek pro výkon profesí se proměňuje také jejich (sebe)pojímaní, rozsah působnosti, obsah i struktura činností. Profese se nacházejí v tranzici – procházejí změnami způsobenými globálními trendy, resortními politikami a dalšími vnějšími i vnitřními vlivy. Cílem projektu je zjistit, jakými tranzicemi v ČR v současnosti pomáhající profese procházejí, a vyhodnotit případné důsledky pro související studijní obory a akademické disciplíny na Masarykově univerzitě, resp. na univerzitách obecně (popř. v rovině resortních politik uplatňovaných vůči profesím). Výzkumem má být zachyceno, co se aktuálně mění v pojetí, rozsahu, obsahu a výkonu zkoumaných profesí při tranzicích.

Následně (2020) bude uskutečněno šíře založené dotazníkové šetření mezi profesionály a jejich vzdělavateli, v němž budou sledovány přechody a problémy typické pro jednotlivé profese a důsledky tranzicí pro vzdělávání profesionálů. Ve třetí fázi (2021) bude řešen problém interprofesionality a interdisciplinarity – prostřednictvím případových studií budou zkoumány profese operující na pomezí disciplín a profesních polí (předpokládá se zdokumentování některých nově se ustavujících interprofesí).

Řada těchto metylačních změn a fúzních genů silně ovlivňuje chování nádoru a je možné je cílit dostupnými léčivy nebo jsou důležitými prognostickými faktory. Obecným cílem projektu je ověřit, zda analýza globálních metylačních profilů a fúzních genů představuje přínos pro terapeutické plánování u dětských pacientů s vysoce rizikovými solidními nádory, u nichž je známá sekvence nádorového exomu.;CZ;;Academic

Inhibice BCR-ABL pomocí inhibitorů tyrozinových kináz (TKI) představuje standard v léčbě CML a většina pacientů odpovídá na podání TKI pozitivně. TKI však často nevede k eradikaci choroby a to z důvodu nově získaných mutací BCR-ABL, způsobujících rezistenci k TKI. Nový alosterický inhibitor ABL001 umožňuje dvojí inhibici BCR-ABL a tím překonání rezistence vůči TKI. Rané výstupy klinických studií ukazují silnou a trvalou odpověď u pacientů s TKI-rezistentní CML na ABL001, ale také jeho toxicitu, jenž může být překážkou budoucích terapií.

Zvýšená náchylnost k fibrilaci síní i komor je pravděpodobně způsobena akutním vlivem těchto léčiv na elektrické vlastnosti srdečních buněk. Jako kandidáty jsme vybrali draslíkové proudy typu „inward rectifier“ (Kir), jelikož hrají významnou roli v patogenezi fibrilací. Kromě samostatného vlivu bude studován i kombinovaný vliv s běžnými plazmatickými koncentracemi baria, a to jak u těchto léčiv, tak u dalších látek působících na Kir kanály (např. u ethanolu, acetaldehydu, nebo nikotinu). Pokusy budou provedeny na izolovaných srdečních buňkách potkana a člověka a na exprimovaných lidských Kir kanálech. Následovat bude analýza EKG in vivo u laboratorních potkanů a matematické simulace na modelech srdečních buněk s cílem prozkoumat proarytmogenní vlastnosti těchto látek. Díky objasnění změn srdečních Kir proudů vyvolaných vybranými léky může tato studie pomoci zabránit výskytu arytmií u pacientů léčených těmito léky.;CZ;;Academic

Během fMRI neurofeedbacku participant v magnetické rezonanci dostává zpětnou vazbu o aktuální úrovni své mozkové aktivity, resp. BOLD signálu, v určité předem definované oblasti mozku. Aktuální signál je poskytován s minimálním zpoždění (např. 1 až 2 sekund). Úkolem participanta je snažit se pomocí zpětné vazby ovlivnit úroveň své mozkové aktivity určitým směrem (tedy např. zvýšit, nebo snížit), a tím se participant učí záměrně regulovat aktivitu svého mozku. fMRI neurofeedback byl v posledních letech úspěšně využit pro zlepšení řady psychiatrických či neurologických obtíží, jako jsou emoční regulace, tinnitus, halucinace či motorické a kognitivní funkce. Menší pozornost je však věnována technickým parametrům fMRI neurofeedbacku, které hrají zásadní roli pro přesné a úspěšné využití této metody. Při extrakci real-time BOLD signálu z určité oblasti je zapotřebí tento signál očistit od globálního signálu mozku a šumu. Tento krok je zásadní pro podobu signálu prezentovaného jako feedback participantům a udává, nakolik tento signál přesně koresponduje s vlastní mozkovou aktivitou. Na projektu spolupracujeme s pracovištěm Centrálního institutu pro duševní zdraví v Mannheimu v Německu, které se výzkumem fMRI neurofeedbacku dlouhodobě zabývá. Tři skupiny zdravých osob (15 osob na skupinu) podstoupí stejný úkol zaměřený na záměrnou regulaci aktivity amygdaly pomocí fMRI neurofeedbacku, který bude každé skupině prezentován pomocí extrakce signálu jednou ze tří vybraných metod. Bude srovnávána přesnost extrahovaného real-time BOLD signálu a úspěšnost regulace amygdaly mezi jednotlivými metodami. Data budou sbírána zároveň v České republice a v Německu. Výsledky přinesou nové poznatky o zásadním aspektu metody fMRI neurofeedbacku.;CZ;;Academic

Současné výsledky ukazují, že vnitrobuněčné regulátory řídí dobu a sílu ERK aktivace, a tak určují specifickou buněčnou odpověď na signalizaci dané RTK.

Cílená terapie se zaměřuje zejména na signální dráhu kinázy ERK, která je ve většině melanomů aktivována mutacemi onkogenů BRAF nebo NRAS. Nové inhibitory BRAF mohou zbrzdit postup onemocnění, většinou však dojde k vývoji rezistence na léčbu. Naše nedávno publikované výsledky naznačují existenci dříve nepopsaného regulačního mechanismu, na němž se podílí proteiny z rodiny KSR (Kinase suppressor of RAS) a řídí jej energetický senzor AMPK, jenž po působení metabolického stresu v buňkách melanomu aktivně moduluje dráhu ERK aktivovanou onkogeny. Předkládaný projekt využije proteomické přístupy a metody molekulární a buněčné biologie k objasnění molekulárních mechanismů, jejichž prostřednictvím reguluje kináza AMPK v buňkách melanomu interakce proteinů KSR s kinázami RAF a aktivitu dráhy ERK. Pochopení těchto nových mechanismů by mohlo vést k novým možnostem léčby nádorů s mutací NRAS a melanomů nesoucích mutaci BRAF V600E, u nichž se vyvinula rezistence k inhibitorům BRAF.;CZ;;academic, student

Změny struktury a/nebo funkce TATS mohou být důsledkem i příčinou srdeční patologie, např. srdečního selhání. Dostupné metodické přístupy pro analýzu funkčních charakteristik TATS poskytují rozdílné výsledky. Proto jsme nedávno navrhli novou metodu ponechávající buňku intaktní a umožňující přesnější odhad vlastností TATS. Tato metoda je založena na výrazném zvýšení elektrického odporu TATS díky expozici měřené buňky izotonickému roztoku s nízkou vodivostí. V rámci tohoto projektu bude nová metoda detailně propracována a zveřejněna. Prostřednictvím této metody získáme nové informace o funkčních charakteristikách TATS u srdečních buněk potkana a člověka.

Komplexní pochopení exprese a funkce CBS, CSE a MPST v nádorových buňkách není zatím stále zcela objasněno. Na základě dosavadních poznatků jsme vytvořili následující hypotézu: na funkci enzymů produkujících H2S by mohla mít vliv jejich lokalizace a míra jejich kompartmentalizace, změny pH a oxidační stav. Při hypoxii by mohla být ovlivněna endogenní produkce H2S a také funkce enzymů produkujících H2S.

Ta vede při translaci k prodloužení polyglutaminového řetězce přes 36 opakování. Huntingtin (HTT) patří mezi proteiny s řadou funkcí a jeho mutace vede pravděpodobně jak ke ztrátě některých normálních funkcí, tak k získání toxického vlivu mutovaného HTT (mHTT). Terapie HD v současné době neexistuje, ale rychlý vývoj nových terapeutických přístupů se zaměřuje hlavně na snižování množství mHTT v organismu.

V zahraniční literatuře existují studie podporující přímou korelaci mezi febrilními křečemi a následným vznikem hipokampální sklerózy (Kuks et al, 1993), dále průkaz atrofie hipokampu po febrilních křečích (Darrell et al, 2014). Na druhou stranu jsou publikovány i studie, které tuto teorii nepodporují a přiklání se k myšlence, že mozek je již primárně poškozen, následně dojde k rozvoji febrilních křečí a to způsobí poškození již pozměněného hipokampu, jeho edém a atrofii (Keith et al, 1996, Simon et al, 2000). V rámci České Republiky prozatím neexistuje studie zabývající se touto problematikou. Naším cílem je tedy vypracování retrospektivní studie a potvrzení či vyvrácení korelace mezi výskytem febrilních křečí a rozvojem hipokampální sklerózy.";CZ;;

Wereables nepředstavují jen např. chytré hodinky, ale zejména celou škálu nostitelných zařízení, které zahrnují biosensory, implantáty, biomedicínské zařízení, elektrochemické články využívající tělních tekutin ke generaci elektrické energie a superkapacitory. Tyto zařízení znamenají obrovský potenciál ve zvýšení kvality života a bezpečnosti. Např. v biomedicínské oblasti v individuální léčbě (point-of-care), kdy je např. nemoc detekována a konstantně monitorována přímo nositelným zařízením na pacientovi, a kdy nositelné zařízení dokáže též vpravit do těla odpovídající objem léčiva. V případě bezpečnostních složek, senzor umožňuje konstantní monitorování a včasné varování v přítomnosti nebezpečných látek, například výbušnin a nervových bojových látek či jejich improvizovaných variant. Tento projekt se zaměří na výzkum a vývoj nositelných sensorů, biosensorů a biopalivových článků v podobě elektrochemických náplastí, elektrochemických tetování a nositelného chytrého oblečení se zabudovanými polyfunkčními polymerními biokomponenty pro efektivní transformaci biomolekul do elektrochemického signálu a elektrické energie.

Selekce vhodných kandidátů k operačnímu řešení však není jednoduchá a neobejde se bez pomocných paraklinických vyšetření, která napomáhají vymezit epileptogenní zónu (oblast mozku, jejíž operační odstranění povede k bezzáchvatovosti).  Standardní součástí této předchirurgické přípravy je mj. vizuální analýza interiktálního PET mozku, která je však do značné míry subjektivní. Objektivní výstup tohoto vyšetření nabízí až jeho, dosud rutinně nevyužívané,  pokročilé zpracování na principu statistického parametrického mapování (SPM), které lze provést dvěma metodami – global normalization (GN – konfirmace pacientských hodnot ke zdravým kontrolám) a asymmetry index (AI – side-to-side analýza u jednoha pacienta). Vzhledem k tomu, že kortikální funkční aktivita, kterou lze definovat na podkladě lokálních metabolických změn právě pomocí PET vyšetření, podléhá zrání a v různém věkovém období jsou různé části kortexu více aktivní než jiné, je obtížné vytvořit univerzální dětskou normu.

Zdokonalením prošly nejen diagnostické zobrazovací metody, ale paralelně s nimi i techniky invazivní endovaskulární či intratumorální léčby. Pokrok v diagnostice umožňuje vyhledávání zhoubného onemocnění v jeho časných stadiích, umožňuje podrobněji charakterizovat nemocnou tkáň pacienta, získáváme informace o individuálních vlastnostech konkrétní léze. Integrace nálezů těchto nových diagnostických metod do terapeutického plánu pacienta umožňuje individualizaci postupů v moderní onkologické léčbě. Miniinvazivní radiologicko-onkologické intervence využívají zobrazovací metody nejen při zákroku, ale jako první z terapeutických metod mohou využít spektrum pokročilých zobrazovacích metod ke sledování léčebné odpovědi. Cílem projektu je analýza přínosu specifických diagnostických a terapeutických postupů využívaných v Komplexním onkologickém centru Masarykova onkologického ústavu v Brně ve spolupráci s Fakultní nemocnicí Brno a Fakultní nemocnicí U Svaté Anny ve srovnání s celorepublikovými daty.

Hlavní překážka v efektivní léčbě glioblastomu je jeho invazivní růst do peritumorózní mozkové tkáně limitující efekt resekce a dále jeho intratumorózní biologická heterogenita oslabující účinnost terapie onkologické. Reziduální onemocnění v peritumorózní mozkové zóně je léčeno onkologicky na základě analýzy tkáně masy tumoru, která byla odstraněna při operaci. S ohledem na vysokou intratumorózní heterogenitu si ovšem nemůžeme být jisti, že charakteristika reziduálního onemocnění je stejná, jaká byla popsána ve tkáni získané operací. Tento fakt může zodpovídat za selhání dosavadních snah o cílenou biologickou léčbu u glioblastomu. Cílem projektu je studium a popis heterogenity významných histopatologických biomarkerů na resekční hranici glioblastomu, tedy na hranici tumor – peritumorózní oblast nádorové infiltrace, na kterou je cílená adjuvantní onkologická léčba.

Termokamera se jeví jako vhodný nástroj pro sledování kvality prokrvení na základě povrchové teploty. Termovize může usnadnit práci chirurgovi pro zjištění ischemizace střeva a vhodného stanovení místa anastomózy. 
Hlavním cílem projektu je užití dynamické termografie v praxi jako užitečného nástroje v rukou chirurga při samotném chirurgickém výkonu. Navrhovaný projekt vychází z předešlého výzkumu a plynule tak navazuje na dosavadní zkušenosti získané na operačním sále. Termokamera napomáhá určit míru prokrvení tlustého střeva a dobře zobrazuje angiosomy při resekčním výkonu. Přidanou hodnotou předkládaného výzkumu je zjištění korelace termografického vyšetření s vyšetřením po podání endocyonové zeleně (ICG) pacientovi. Pacienti budou termograficky vyšetřeni během plánovaného chirurgického výkonu. Specifita projektu je dána porovnáním dynamické termografie a ICG, dvou moderních metod pro stanovení kvality prokrvení.

Je zaměřen na studium  deficitů v tvorbě protilátek a výzkum dysregulace v komplementovém systému – jmenovitě u deficitu C1-INH – hereditárního angioedému (HAE).
V oblasti HAE budeme pokračovat ve sledování významu a rozsahu aktivace granulocytů v klidovém období i v době ataky (MUDr. R. Hakl). Dále se budeme zabývat sekvenováním intronových oblastí genu SERPING1 (je zodpovědný za HAE) a testováním vlivu detekovaných variant na sestřih pre-mRNA u 4 rodin, u nichž dosavadní analýza neprokázala kauzální mutaci tohoto genu (Mgr. P. Hujová). Budeme též pokračovat v podrobnějším studiu regulačních mechanizmů sestřihu a exprese mRNA genu SERPING1, včetně prací na konfirmaci hypotézy o autoregulaci exprese C1-INH (Mgr. T. Kováčová).
V části věnované protilátkovým imunodeficitům budeme pokračovat ve stanovení střevního mikrobiomu (bakteriální i houbové frakce) u nemocných se závažnou primární agamoglobulinémií - běžným variabilním imunodeficitem (CVID) s využitím stávajících metod fragmentační analýzy (FA) pro houby a sekvenování nové generace (NGS) pro bakterie (Mgr. K. Fiedorová, Mgr. I. Kotásková). 
Z hlediska patogeneze se budeme věnovat významu deficitní stimulace B-lymfocytů T-lymfocyty u nemocných s CVID. B-lymfocyty pacientů s CVID budou stimulovány T-dependentními i T-independentními signály. Výsledky budou analyzovány metodou mnohobarevné průtokové cytometrie a ELISA (Mgr. P. Slanina).
MUDr. Hlaváčková bude pokračovat ve sběru klinických a laboratorních údajů o sekundárních poruchách tvorby protilátek, která se vyvíjí po léčbě cílené na ablaci B-lymfocytů, zejména se zaměřením na rekonstituci B-lymfocytárních subpopulací a tvorbu protilátek po proběhlé léčbě.

Hlavním cílem současného projektu je studium zánětlivých změn v plexus choroideus (CP) laboratorního potkana po navození subarachnoidálního krvácení (SAK). Projekt bude zaměřen na studium exprese hemoxygenázy 1 (HO-1), biliverdin reduktázy (BVR), toll-like receptoru (TLR) 4 a 9.
Na experimentálním modelu laboratorního potkana bylo zjištěno, že SAK indukuje proliferaci buněk CP a zánětlivou reakci reprezentovanou invazí aktivovaných makrofágů. Rozvoj zánětlivých změn je přisuzován rozpadovým produktům krve, především hemu, šířícím se likvorovými cestami k buňkám CP. Enzym HO-1 a BVR zvyšují odbourávaní hemoglobinu po SAK. Tyto enzymy byly popsané v různých částech mozku kromě CP. Domníváme, že zvýšená exprese HO-1 a BVR může přispět k rozvoji zánětlivých změn v CP po SAK. Je známo, že TLR9 a TLR4 mohou ovlivňovat spoje typu zonulae occludentes. Předpokládáme, že rozpadové produkty krve v subarachnoidálním prostoru mohou zvyšovat expresi TLR4 a TLR9 a tím vyvolat oslabení hematolikvorové bariéry a rozvoj nitrolební hypertenze po SAK. 
Využitím stereotaktického rámu bude u experimentální skupiny zvířat aplikováno 200μl autologní arteriální krve do prechiasmatické cisterny.

Výskyt obtížného zajištění dýchacích cest (obtížná ventilace obličejovou maskou, obtížná laryngoskopie, cannot intubate – cannot ventilate-  CICV – difficult airway) v pediatrické anestezii není přesně definován. Difficult airway je spojen se signifikantní morbiditou a mortalitou dětských pacientů v perioperační péči. 
Úvod a odborná charakteristika:
Majorita difficult airway v pediatrické populaci je predikovatelná, nicméně obtížné zajištění dýchacích cest a případné selhání ventilace a oxygenace pediatrických pacientů patří mezi nejčastější fatální komplikace spojené s dětskou anestezii. Možnost efektivní predikce obtížného zajištění poskytuje možnost vyhnout se kritické situaci na operačním sále a naplánovat postup pro potenciální obtížné zajištění dýchacích cest (difficult airway). Předoperační zhodnocení a predikce obtížného zajištění dýchacích cest patří mezi standardní části předanestetsického vyšetření, ačkoliv rozsah a testy použity k predikci difficult airway se liší v závislosti od jednotlivého pracoviště. S cílem identifikovat potenciální rizikové pacienty bude u pacientů před plánovanou operaci na anesteziologické ambulanci hodnocena vzdálenost mezi řezáky (nad 3 prsty pacienta, pod 3 prsty pacienta, pod 2 prsty pacienta, méně jak 1 prst pacienta a v cm). Bude hodnocena mobilita krční páteře – volný předklon a záklon. Dále bude měřena thyreomentální vzdálenost – stanovena dle prstů pacienta a cm při maximální extenzi, hodnota Mallampati skore, výška a váha pacienta, dále bude hodnocena protruze mandibuly – upper lip bite test (vše dle spolupráce pacienta). Na operačním sále bude sledována poloha pacienta k operačnímu výkonu (horizontální, podložka pod hlavou podložka pod rameny), metoda zajištění dýchacích cest (obličejová masky, LM, intuabace), úspěšnost metody (1., 2., pokus, nutnost alternativního zajištění dýchacích cest) použití myorelaxancií. Bude hodnocen výskyt obtížné ventilace obličejovou maskou, obtížného zavedení laryngeální masky, obtížné laryngoskopie a situace cannot intubace/cannot ventilate – CICV. Statistickými metodami bude hodnocena prediktabilita jednotlivých testů k predikci Cormack-Leehane ≥3.

Výskyt difficult airway v pediatrické populaci je málo frekventní ve srovnání s dospělou populaci a majorita obtížného zajištění DC v pediatrické populaci je predikovatelná pomocí standardních testů";CZ;;Academic

V teoretické části je rozvedena problematika heteroforií a souvisejích pojmů, praktická část se poté zabývá samotným měřením. 

Heteroforie je vlastně skryté šilhání, jde o poruchu okohybných svalů, která však není na pohled patrná. Pacientům může způsobovat bolesti hlavy, pálení očí nebo dvojité vidění. Často se dostavují i astenopické potíže, což je neostré, mlhavé vidění, které je způsobené oční únavou. Tyto obtíže se projevují především při práci do blízka, v současné době se tato problematika týká hlavně práce s počítačem. Práce se tedy zaměří na pacienty, kteří trpí heteroforií a na to, jak tato porucha ovlivňuje jejich práci na počítači. Každý pacient vyplní dotazník, který bude zaměřen na věk, pohlaví a dále informace týkající se práce s počítačem (doba, kterou tráví u počítače nebo otázky týkající se výše zmíněných příznaků). Poté bude změřena jejich subjektivní refrakce a hodnota heteroforie do dálky i na počítačovou vzdálenost (70 cm). Druhou částí výzkumu je použití eye-trackingu pro měření rychlosti očních pohybů u pacientů s heteroforií na začátku a po několika hodinách práce s počítačem za předpokladu, že heteroforie bude negativně ovlivňovat rychlost očních pohybů a tedy efektivitu jejich pracovního výkonu.

Závěrem práce bude ověřit stanovené hypotézy a navrhnout nové možnosti korekce pro tyto pacienty. Zároveň půjde o inovativní použití eye-trackeru v oblasti optometrie.";CZ;;student, employee

Onemocnění je charakterizováno poruchou krátkodobé episodické paměti, ale již v časném stádiu onemocnění, tj. mírné kognitivní poruchy (MPK-AN) dochází rovněž k poruše zrakové pozornosti a zrakově-prostorových funkcí. Parkinsonova nemoc (PN) je druhé nejčastější neurodegenerativní onemocnění mozku po AN. Prevalence PN je obecně odhadovaná na 0.3 % v celé populaci a na 1% v populaci nad 60 let. K výraznému nárůstu incidence dochází po 60. roce života. Mimo charakteristické progresivní pohybové postižení je PN často doprovázena psychickými změnami. Kognitivní poruchy postihují 80% nemocných a již v časných fázích PN má 20-25% pacientů objektivní kognitivní deficit, který splňuje kritéria pro mírnou kognitivní poruchu při PN (MKP-PN). Přítomnost MKP-PN je rizikovým faktorem pro vznik demence u PN. Mezi nejčastější kognitivní deficity v časném stadiu PN patří dysexekutivní syndrom a poruchy zpracování zrakových informací. Přes značný výzkum v této oblasti nejsou neurobiologické mechanismy vedoucí ke vzniku kognitivní poruchy u pacientů s PN stále dostatečně známy. Demence při AN i PN má negativní dopad na soběstačnost pacienta, sociální a pracovní zařazení, kvalitu života pacienta i pečovatele a je spojena s významným zvýšením morbidity/mortality. Včasná identifikace pacientů s rizikem vzniku MKP a demence při AN a PN je proto důležitou prioritou. 
V projektu budeme zkoumat behaviorální a neurální koreláty zpracování zrakových informací a jejich poruch u pacientů s PN s a bez přítomnosti kognitivního deficitu a u pacientů s MKP-AN. U pacientů s MKP-AN budeme navíc sledovat neurální koreláty paměťových poruch hodnocených testem asociačního učení.

Zatímco HT je možné diagnostikovat změřením tlaku krve (TK), diagnostika OSA vyžaduje finančně, technicky i časově náročné polysomnografické vyšetření, což je jeden z důvodů, proč je OSA poddiagnostikována. Navíc, z doposud neobjasněných příčin, jen někteří pacienti s HT reagují na terapii kontinuálním pozitivním přetlakem (CPAP) snížením TK; dosažení cílových hodnot TK je přitom zásadní pro snížení kardiovaskulárního rizika.
Nové markery, které by umožnily snadnější diagnostiku OSA nebo odhad pacientovy reakce na terapii, by mohly přispět k časnějšímu zahájení terapie u responzivních pacientů. Těmito markery by mohly být cirkulující mikroRNA – lehce dostupné (např. plasma) a stabilní molekuly, jejichž hladiny se mění vlivem různých stimulů (např. zvýšení TK, hypoxie) a mohou tak sloužit k diagnostice a odhadu prognózy u pacientů s HT a OSA.
Primární cíl projektu je identifikace mikroRNA, které bude možné použít pro diagnostiku/skreening OSA u pacientů s hypertenzí. Sekundární cíl je u pacientů se zjištěnou OSA identifikovat mikroRNA, které budou predikovat snížení krevního tlaku po zahájení terapie kontinuálním pozitivním přetlakem (CPAP), tedy identifikovat ty pacienty, kteří z terapie pomocí CPAP budou nejvíce profitovat.

Tento trend bude mít pro náš způsob života dnes ještě těžko odhadnutelné socioekonomické důsledky. Z analýz Světové banky i dalších zdrojů je víc než zřejmé, že zvyšováni světové populace, kterého jsme svědky, je vázáno především na zvyšování střední doby života a ne na porodnost, a to zejména ve vyspělých zemích světa . Země jako například Japonsko, které vykazuje třetí nejhorší porodnost na světě , již intenzivně pociťují negativní trendy ve stárnutí populace. 
Stejně jako ve světě, i u nás můžeme rozpoznat dva významné trendy ve vývoji poruch reprodukce. Jednak značná část populace, ve vyspělých zemích okolo 15% , nemůže počít přirozenou cestou, ačkoli příčina není zcela známá. Další část populace odkládá reprodukci na pozdější dobu, kdy je mateřství spojeno s velkými riziky jako pro matku tak i pro plod. Uvedené trendy vedou ke stále se zvyšující potřebě technik asistované reprodukce. Zásadním problémem těchto metod je ovšem selhání vývoje vajíček a embryí a jejich neschopnost vytvořit plnohodnotný lidský plod. 
Výzkum v oblasti poruch lidské reprodukce, tak jako i výzkum v oblasti nových technik asistované reprodukce je nejen u nás, ale i ve světě trvale podfinancován. V kontrastu s jinými medicínsky významnými problémy je podpora výzkumu poruch reprodukce na národní úrovni velmi málo zastoupená a platforma přímé podpory výzkumu tohoto typu prakticky neexistuje. A přitom je zřejmé, že reprodukční problémy představují do budoucna celosvětově obrovský socioekonomický problém. Využití metod asistované reprodukce bude vykazovat stále vrůstající tendenci.

Targeted therapy
of melanoma is aimed mainly at the ERK kinase signalling pathway, activated in most melanomas by BRAF or
NRAS oncogenic mutations. BRAF inhibitors can delay the progression of the disease, but they usually cannot
cure it.
Recent findings show an important role of the activated ERK pathway in the characteristic reprogramming of
cancer cell energy metabolism, potentially offering new therapeutic targets. However, our recent data suggest
the presence of a previously unknown feedback mechanism, promoting further activation of the ERK pathway in
cancer cells in response to metabolic stress, in a manner dependent on the type of oncogenic mutation driving
ERK pathway activity.
The proposed project will unravel molecular mechanisms linking cell energy metabolism to the ERK pathway in
BRAF- and NRAS-mutated cancer cells. We will concentrate on the roles of the interactions of RAF, KSR, and
AMPK proteins that were identified in our experiments as critical regulators of MEK/ERK activity in melanoma
cells treated with small molecule inhibitors of cell energy metabolism.
Based on our preliminary data, we believe that by analysing the response of cancer cells to metabolic stress and
their dependence on individual metabolic pathways for survival, our project could also define combinations of
drugs targeting cell metabolism suitable as alternative treatments for cases when malignant melanoma tumours
become resistant to clinically used BRAF inhibitors.";CZ;;academic, student

Naše hypotéza tvrdí, že shluky oxidativního poškození bází DNA jsou konvertovány prostřednictvím BER do dvojřetězcových zlomů (DSBs), které jsou dále bezchybně opravovány rychlým MMEJ, zatímco pluripotenci ovládající proteiny spolupracují na ochraně konců DNA před HR a NHEJ.

Tato metoda je založena na výrazném zvýšení elektrického odporu TATS díky expozici měřené buňky izotonickému roztoku s nízkou vodivostí. Zejména je důležité, že tato metoda ponechává měřenou buňku intaktní a tedy dostupnou pro opakovaná měření a stanovení vlastností povrchové i TATS membrány u stejné buňky na rozdíl od široce používané detubulace. Cílem projektu je novou metodu doladit, prokázat a demonstrovat její využitelnost a spolehlivost a rovněž získat nové údaje popisující funkční parametry TATS u srdečních buněk potkana z různých oblastí srdce. Experimentální data budou následně využita ke zpřesnění popisu TATS v našich dříve publikovaných modelech srdečních buněk potkana, což umožní přesněji předpovědět vliv TATS na elektromechanickou aktivitu srdečních buněk.;CZ;;Academic

Cílená terapie se zaměřuje zejména na signální dráhu kinázy ERK, která je ve většině případů aktivována mutacemi onkogenů BRAF nebo NRAS. Inhibitory BRAF mohou zbrzdit postup onemocnění, většinou je však nedokáží vyléčit. Poznatky z poslední doby ukazují význam aktivace dráhy ERK pro typické přeprogramování energetického metabolismu nádorových buněk, jenž samo o sobě také nabízí potenciální cíle pro terapii. Naše nové výsledky však ukazují na existenci doposud nepopsané zpětné vazby, jež po působení metabolického stresu vede k další aktivaci dráhy ERK v nádorových buňkách. Předkládaný projekt má blíže určit nové molekulární mechanismy spojující energetický metabolismus s aktivitou dráhy ERK v buňkách nesoucích onkogenní mutace BRAF a NRAS, zejména význam vzájemných interakcí proteinů RAF, KSR a AMPK.

Tyto dvě vlastnosti jsou podmíněny rychlým buněčným cyklem a vysokou expresí pluripotenčních transkripčních faktorů (Oct4, Nanog), které řídí i expresi malých nekódujících RNA (miRNA). Po indukci diferenciace u lidských EKB dochází vždy ke spomalení buněčné proliferace a snížení exprese specifických transkripčních faktorů i miRNA. Funkce a interakce těchto molekul a jejich vlyv na buněčné dělení je proto intenzivně studována. Zajímavé je, že po diferenciaci lidských EK buněk speficky do neurálních kmenových buněk (NKB) dojde k mírnému spomalení buněčného dělení i ke snížení exprese miRNA a proteinů Oct4 a Nanog. Buňky si ale přesto zachovají schopnost neomezeně se dělit i diferencovat se do neuronů a glií. Jakým mechanismem NKB tyto procesy regulují není přesně popsáno. A protože deregulace buněčného dělení a diferenciace souvisí se vznikem různých onemocnění, studium právě techto mechanismů může pomoct odhalit kandidátní molekuly pro budoucí terapie.

Mozková tkáň podléhá patologickým změnám ve formě hromadění β-amyloidního plaku (Aβ) a hyperfosforylovaného proteinu Tau. Pro studium AD se v současnosti využívají geneticky modifikované buněčné linie i zvířecí modely, které však nejsou schopny plně rekapitulovat všechny aspekty patologie lidského CNS. Rozvoj biologie kmenových buněk a možnosti jejich získání přímo z pacientů jsou proto velkým příslibem modelování komplexních neurodegenerativních nemocí včetně AD. Recentně bylo ukázáno, že buněčné přeprogramování pacientských buněk do indukovaných pluripotentních kmenových buněk (iPSCs) a následná kultivace tzv. „Cerebrálních organoidů“ in vitro poskytuje nadějnou metodu pro bližší poznání Alzheimerovy choroby (Kim et al., 2015). Tyto 3D kultury Alzheimerovy choroby vykazují klíčové události patogeneze AD, včetně agregace Aβ a hromadění hyperfosforylovaného proteinu Tau a představují tak jedinečný nástroj pro výzkum AD. V České republice takovýto model prozatím nebyl ustaven. 
Cílem této práce je vytvořit model 3D cerebrálních organoidů pro studium Alzheimerovy choroby přímo z buněk pacientů a ověřit, zda funkčně rekapitulují znaky AD. V první fázi projektu bude probíhat optimalizace protokolů pro kultivaci 3D cerebrálních organoidů z kmenových buněk, ve druhé fázi pak funkčně ověříme, zda námi ustanovený buněčný model rekapituluje patologii Alzheimerovy choroby. Nad rámec tohoto projektu budou vykultivované 3D cerebrální organoidy sloužit k potvrzení hypotéz týkajících se zastoupení gangliosidů v procesu stárnutí a vzniku AD.

Vývoj mléčné žlázy je jedinečný tím, že probíhá z velké části postnatálně a že jeho součástí jsou výrazné repetitivní cyklické změny v struktuře epitelu v průběhu těhotenství, laktace a involuce, kdy změny v expresi ženských pohlavních hormonů způsobují proliferaci či naopak apoptózu epiteliálních buněk.

Je dobře známo, že intenzita oxidačního stresu závisí na závažnosti termického poškození a také na antioxidačním stavu organismu, ale dosud nejsou definovány žádné biochemické parametry (markery oxidativního stresu) související s pravděpodobností  rozvoje infekčních komplikací. Dalším průvodním jevem termického traumatu je rozvoj sytémového zánětu  (SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome) s pozdějšími projevy imunodeficitu, který je také jednou z příčin zvýšené náchylnosti infekcím. Cílem našeho projektu je nalezení souvislostí mezi markery oxidativního stresu a vznikem imunodeficitu a infekce u těžce a kriticky popálených pacientů, které by umožnily na základě  stanovení biochemických parametrů oxidativního stresu individualizaci mikrobiologických vyšetření během léčby.

Od roku 2016 jsme zavedli do komplexního vyšetřovacího panelu též whole exome sequencing a transkripční profilování. Pilotní pozorování ukazují, že nejlepší léčebné odpovědi je v případě theranostického přístupu dosahováno u pacientů, u kterých jsou v souladu genomická, transkriptomická a fosfoproteomická data.

Tento proces je závislý nejen na rozeznání samotných sestřihových míst, ale i na přítomnosti exonových a intronových elementů regulujících sestřih, jejichž narušení mutacemi může výrazně ovlivnit úspěšnost sestřihu pre-mRNA do zralé mRNA. Především v oblasti diagnostiky dědičných onemocnění bývají intronové mutace opomíjeny. Cílem projektu je ověřit, v jaké míře mohou být intronové mutace zodpovědné za narušení samotného sestřihu se zaměřením na sestřih pre-mRNA genu SERPING1 a následný rozvoj hereditárního angioedému (HAE). U části pacientů trpících HAE nebyla prokázána kauzální mutace v žádném z exonů genu SERPING1, přestože byla odhalena snížená hladina proteinu v krevní plasmě. Možnými kandidáty na kauzální mutace jsou právě intronové mutace. Vzhledem k tomu, že vliv vzdálených intronových mutací není jednoznačně predikovatelný, bude vliv takovýchto mutací experimentálně ověřován. K tomu bude využito unikátní metody vyvinuté již dříve na CEITEC MU, která umožňuje sledovat vliv velkého množství mutací cílového genu v jediném experimentu pomocí sekvenování příští generace. Samotná metoda byla vyvinuta a vyzkoušena na exonových mutacích, nicméně její hlavní přednost spočívá právě v ověřování vlivu nukleotidových záměn, které nejsou zahrnuty ve výsledných transkriptech jako je tomu například u intronových mutací. Tento dosud nevyužívaný přístup k řešení dané problematiky bude vyžadovat jak vyřešení dílčích metodických specifik, tak vývoj bionformatických nástrojů pro analýzu sekvenačních dat a jejich interpretaci v kontextu rozvoje HAE u pacientů. Využití tohoto přístupu by bylu unikátní jak při řešení obecných otázek spojených se sestřihem tak při lékařské diagnostice. Spolupráce pracovišť CEITEC , LF a FI MU umožní provést rozsáhlejší analýzy vlivu intronových mutací, které nebyly dříve možné, jak v kontextu reálné diagnostiky HAE, tak s ohledem na obecné znalosti týkající se intronových regulátorů sestřihu.;CZ;;Academic

Nicméně jak tyto regulátory fungují na molekulární úrovni je velmi málo známo. V rámci tohoto projektu využijeme revoluční technologie studia biochemických porcesů v reálném čase a to jak ve směsi, tak na jednomolekulové úrovni. Určení mechanismu regulace HR zlepší naše chápání molekulární podstaty karcinogeneze a může představovat unikátní možnost pro terapeutické využití.;CZ;;Academic

Časná diagnostika poruch paměti toto riziko významně sníží.
Nově se objevující druhy léčiv s sebou sice přinášejí naději na úspěšnější řešení různých chorobných stavů, klinická zkoušení léků však často pacienty vyššího věku multimorbidní a se sníženou soběstačnosti nezahrnují. Proto je důležité věnovat pozornost případným novým komplikacím spojeným se zavedením nového léčiva - v poslední době konkrétně skupiny nových orálních antikoagulancií.
Nadále bude věnována pozornost preventivním aktivitám podporujícím úspěšné stárnutí a předcházejícím ztrátě soběstačnosti seniorů. U hospitalizovaných nemocných  bude věnována pozornost rychlosti návratu míry soběstačnosti seniora v závislosti na intenzitě rehabilitace. Projekt je i v nadcházejícím roce věnován různým směrům dlouhodobé prevence multimorbidity jako faktoru významně urychlujícího vznik závislosti seniora a zhoršení kvality jeho života. Jedním z komplexně působících faktorů je vitamin D, jehož nízká hladina má vliv mimo jiné i senzitivitu tkání k inzulinu, a tedy stav kompenzace diabetu včetně rozvoje chronických komplikací diabetu.   Farmakoterapie a zejména compliance a adherence jsou také významnými riziky ztráty soběstačnosti. Na druhé straně je nutno věnovat pozornost o volně nakupovaným medikamentům, a to zejména steroidům pro jejich četné nežádoucí vedlejší účinky.";CZ;;Academic

Návrh navazuje na projekt MUNI/A/1183/2015 Patogeneze a léčba humorální imunodeficiencí. Je zaměřen na deficity v tvorbě protilátek a dysregulaci v komplementovém systému – jmenovitě u deficitu C1-INH – hereditárního angioedému (HAE). 
V oblasti HAE budeme pokračovat ve sledování významu a rozsahu aktivace granulocytů v klidovém období i v době ataky. Dále budeme sledovat některé klinické aspekty tohoto onemocnění, zejména možnosti léčby HAE v těhotenství (Dr. R. Hakl, Dr. E. Hlaváčková). 
V molekulárně-genetické části projektu budeme analyzovat 2 rodiny s klinickou diagnózou HAE, u nichž nebyla původně detekována kauzální mutace v genu SERPING1 ani v genu pro koagulační faktor XII. Zároveň budeme pokračovat v analýze oblastí genu SERPING1, které mají význam pro regulaci sestřihu mRNA a expresi C1 inhibitoru. (Mgr. T. Kováčová). 
V části zabývající se protilátkovými imunodeficity plánujeme pokračovat v projektu stanovení mikrobiomu stolice u nemocných s agamoglobulinímií typu běžného variabilního imunodeficitu (CVID) a selektivního deficitu IgA (IgAD) s využitím metody next generation sequencing. Zároveň plánujeme i střevní mykobiom (složení hub) pomocí molekulárních metod – zejména metody fragmentační analýzy. Pacienti s těmito diagnózami postrádají klíčovou slizniční protilátku IgA. Absence IgA protilátek může hrát roli ve vzniku infekcí a jiných enteropatií, ke kterým jsou pacienti s CVID velmi náchylní. Zároveň u těchto pacientů předpokládáme zvýšený výskyt střevní dysmikrobie (Mgr. K. Fiedorová). V návaznosti na tuto část projektu se budeme zabývat možnostmi detekce bakterií a hub v polymikrobiálních klinických vzorcích (Mgr. Iva Kotásková).
Budeme se rovněž zabývat vlivem sekvenčních změn v genu BTK (jehož defekt způsobuje primární poruchu tvorby protilátek) na regulaci sestřihu mRNA (Mgr. K. Novanská).  
Dále budou sledovány některé klinické a laboratorní aspekty sekundárního imunodeficitu, který se vyvíjí u dětských pacientů po léčbě rituximabem (Dr. E. Hlaváčková). 
Jako formu výstupů předpokládáme především prezentaci na konferencích, ale též přípravu publikaci na téma komplikací HAE v těhotenství (Dr. Hakl) a o  významu mutací ovlivňujících sestřih mRNA v genech způsobujících primární imunodeficience (Mgr. Kováčová).";CZ;;Academic

Prevalence PN je obecně odhadovaná na 0.3 % v celé populaci a na 1% v populaci nad 60 let. Incidence PN je pak 8-18 nových případu na 100 tisíc obyvatel každý rok. K výraznému nárůstu incidence dochází po 60. roce života. Mimo charakteristického progresivního pohybového postižení je PN často doprovázena psychickými změnami. Kognitivní poruchy postihují až 90% nemocných a již v časných fázích PN má 20-25% pacientů objektivní kognitivní deficit, který splňuje kritéria pro mírnou kognitivní poruchu při PN (MKP). Přítomnost MKP je rizikovým faktorem pro vznik demence u PN. Mezi nejčastější kognitivní deficity v časném stadiu PN patří dysexekutivní syndrom a poruchy zpracování zrakových informací. Přes značný výzkum v této oblasti nejsou neurobiologické mechanismy vedoucí ke vzniku kognitivní poruchy u pacientů s PN stále dostatečně známy. Demence při PN má negativní dopad na soběstačnost pacienta, sociální a pracovní zařazení kvalitu života pacienta i pečovatele a je spojena s významným zvýšením morbidity/mortality. Včasná identifikace pacientů s rizikem vzniku MKP a demence při PN je proto důležitou prioritou.
V projektu „Zpracování zrakových informací u pacientů s Parkinsonovou nemocí“ budeme zkoumat behaviorální a neurální koreláty (poruch) zpracování zrakových informací u pacientů s PN s MKP a s PN bez přítomnosti kognitivního deficitu.

Navzdory tomu, problém interakce mezi biologickými systémy a magnetickými poli není vyřešený. Hlavním cílem projektu je, díky interdisciplinárnímu přístupu a unikátnímu technickému vybavení, zásadně přispět k poznání humánní magnetorecepce. Projekt staví na dvou aktuálních faktech: 1) fenomén humánní magnetorecepce se dostal na úroveň, kdy může navázat na pevně zakotvenou metodickou i vědomostní základnu vybudovanou studiem živočišné magnetorecepce, na které má skupina navrhovatele podíl. 2) pokrok neurověd umožňuje díky novým nástrojům odhalit neurální podstatu dříve pouze empiricky známých psychogenních, paranormálních či jiných fenoménů, dosavadními metodami nevysvětlitelných (např. fenomén déja-vu popsaný pracovníky Neurověd). Z nich vychází plán spolupráce 5 subjektů z MU dávající ojedinělou a originální kombinaci metod a přístupů.
Biologie (UEBPř.fak.) má největší zkušenosti s výzkumem magnetorecepce u živočichů a disponuje vyspělou metodologií pro její studium, m.j. odstíněnou komorou umožňující simulovat libovolný přirozený magnetický vektor. Geofyzika (UGVPř.fak.) je schopna fyzikálně přesně definovat terénní anomálie magnetického pole a provést experimenty s reakcí velké skupiny pokusných osob. Neurovědy (CEITEC a LF) jsou schopny pomocí sledování behaviorálních, motorických i elektrofyziologických charakteristik pozitivních respondentů v laboratoři přiblížit jak mechanismus recepce tak i zapojení struktur mozku. Pomocí 3T NMR může zjišťovat možné anatomické odchylky a funkční, efektivní konektivitu mezi vybranými mozkovými oblastmi. Pracoviště FSS zajistí kontrolu psychologických faktorů nutně doprovázejících výzkum humánní magnetorecepce, jejíž absence mohla mít zásadní vliv na heterogennost výsledků předešlých studií. Integrální zpracování a intepretace heterogenních dat, kontrola experimentálního designu, i následné zpracování dat je v projektu řešeno ve spolupráci s bioinformatiky IBA. 
Pozitivní nález a popis humánní magnetorecepce by byl zásadním impulzem pro otevírající se novou oblast smyslové a nervové fyziologie člověka. Pro společenský význam tématu, kvalitně metodicky zvládnutá studie může poskytnout cenné a dobře publikovatelné informace i v případě negativních nálezů. To zajistí možnost ucházet se o projekty, pro které by byla první, zjišťovací fáze výzkumu příliš riskantní.";CZ;;Academic

Perspektivním přístupem při terapii nádorových onemocnění se zdá být enkapsulace již ověřených chemoterapeutik za pomocí kavitandů jako jsou cucurbit[n]urily, resp. vhodných nanomateriálů. Slibnou alternativou k tomuto postupu je rovněž využití látek založených na PtIV případně na neplatinových kovech (např. ruthenium). Látky založené na PtIV vykazují obecně nižší reaktivitu v porovnání s klasickými platinovými cytostatiky. Projekt je postaven na hypotéze, že lze za pomoci racionálního designu kavitandů (přenašečů) a promyšlených modifikací platinových (PtIV) a rutheniových (RuIII) léčiv dosáhnout výrazné redukce toxicity na nenádorové tkáně a zlepšit cílení jejich účinku v porovnání s běžně užívanými chemoterapeutiky. V tomto projektu bude porovnána účinnost a mechanismus cytostatik konvenčně užívaných k léčbě daných onemocnění prostaty (docetaxel), prsu (doxorubicin), a kolorekta (deriváty cisplatiny) (a) s nově syntetizovanými léčivy na bázi platinyIV a rutheniaIII, (b) s konvenčními léčivy enkapsulovanými do kavitandů, (c) s nově syntetizovanými deriváty enkapsulovanými do kavitandů a (d) kavitandů modifikovaných pro další cílení léčiv. Práce si tak klade následující cíle: (1) design, příprava a charakterizace nových modifikací platinových a rutheniových léčiv a supramolekulárních komplexů nových i existujících chemoterapeutik s kavitandy jako jsou cucurbiturily, cyklodextriny, calixareny, (2) Porovnání cytotoxického účinku nových derivátů platinových a rutheniových léčiv oproti léčivům rutinně užívaným k léčbě karcinomů prsu, prostaty a kolorekta v in vitro experimentech, (3) Detailní charakterizace vlivu nových platinových a rutheniových derivátů na výše uvedené nádorové buněčné linie – analýza genové exprese na úrovni mRNA a proteinu, analýza změny buněčných procesů a buněčných smrtí, analýza změny metalomu v buňkách (distribuce platiny a ruthenia a dalších kovů – zinek, měď, železo aj.), (4) Ověření in-vitro experimentů na in-vivo myších modelech po indukci nádorů kolorekta, prsu a prostaty.

V této souvislosti předpokládáme rovněž rozdíly ve sledovaných parametrech mezi chůzí na pevné zemi a na běhátku. A právě metody jako podobarometrie, kinematická analýza a dynamometrie, které umožňují analýzu hlavních parametrů identifikujících chůzi, mohou být velmi přesným indikátorem změn chůze, a to jak při srovnání chůze na pevné zemi a běhátku, tak při výzkumu patologií chůze způsobených úrazy, či nevhodnou obuví apod. V návaznosti na uvedené metody budeme vytvářet normy pro hodnocení efektivity léčebné terapie úrazových stavů dolních končetin. Cílem projektu je vytvořit a experimentálně ověřit normu chůze definovanou zejména distribucí plantárních tlaků a kinematickými a dynamickými parametry chůze a to jednak pro chůzi na pevné podložce, a rovněž na běhátku. Přidanou hodnotou plánovaného „základního výzkumu chůze“ bude následné využití experimentálně ověřených norem chůze pro navazující výzkumy např. v oblasti vlivu specifických stélek na stav nožní klenby u různých skupin populace, či v oblasti diagnostiky rehabilitace poúrazových stavů dolních končetin. Základem výzkumu bude analýza chůze uvedenými metodami u souborů jedinců různého věku i pohlaví. Z naměřených dat bude provedena typologie chůze a došlapu a bude vytvořena intervalová norma optimální chůze a rozložení plantárních tlaků při chůzi. Intervaly normy budou reflektovat zejména věkové a somatické parametry. Typologie došlapu bude vycházet z hodnocení časového průběhu plantárních tlaků a sil působících při došlapu. Dalším krokem výzkumu pak bude aplikace skórovacích systémů do procesu hodnocení chůze a klenby nohy u specifických skupin populace.

Potřeba a zájem vytvářet a uplatňovat v medicíně inovativní moderní postupy naráží stále více na omezenost zdrojů. To vedlo a stále vede k hledání a zlepšování nástrojů podporujících racionální 
a objektivní rozhodování o těchto, většinou veřejných, finančních zdrojích v zájmu zajištění kvalitní péče při zachování principu rovného a spravedlivého přístupu. Hodnocení zdravotnických technologií (HTA) je jedním z takových nástrojů. Hledání rovnováhy mezi ekonomickými pohledy a modely, snahou zastavit nárůst výdajů a zachováním dostupnosti intervencí spolu s novými etickými výzvami, jež přináší personalizovaná medicína, je proces složitý. Naprosto zásadní je pak provádění těchto hodnocení dle propracovaných a standardizovaných metodik, jež na národní úrovni v této chvíli absentují. Jedním z navrhovaných pilířů a cílů projektu je tedy metodicky orientovaný výzkum s vypracováním návrhu adekvátní metodiky, které bude zohledňovat evropské standardy i národní specifika. Základním předpokladem úspěšné implementace a realizace HTA je pak dostupnost potřebných dat, a to nejen strukturovaných dat klinických, ale i dat vztahujících se k hodnocení nákladů péče. Dalším cílem projektu je tedy mapování dostupnosti a datové základny pro oblast HTA, a to modelově na příkladu péče o diabetické pacienty. Diabetes je celospolečensky závažné onemocnění, které má kromě medicínských aspektů léčby i významné ekonomické a sociální dopady. Náklady na léčbu těchto jsou čerpány jednak ze zdravotního pojištění, současně však mají nezanedbatelný finanční dopad i v oblasti sociální. Pouze část těchto nákladů představují náklady na primární léčbu, větší část financí je čerpána na léčbu chronických komplikací. Z těchto důvodů byl vybrán segment diabetické péče pro modelové zpracování v rámci tohoto projektu, přičemž finálně předpokládáme, jako poslední pilíř projektu, vytvoření HTA analýzy pro vybranou skupinu diabetických pacientů, a to dle vypracované metodiky a s využitím strukturované datové základny.";CZ;;Academic

Ve velké většině zahrnují jejich projevy srdeční selhání. Výzkum procesu selhání mechanické srdeční funkce na buněčné a molekulární úrovni lze sledovat a modelovat již na jednotlivých srdečních buňkách. Kardiomyocyty lze bez zásahu do srdeční tkáně získat diferenciací z indukovaných pluripotentních kmenových buněk (iPS). Srdeční buňky tak vyrůstají a tepají v laboratorní misce, stačí malý kousek kůže dárce. Pokud je dárcem člověk s dědičným onemocněním srdce, lze u jeho srdečních buněk sledovat mechanické a elektrické projevy.
Růst na běžných površích však nedovoluje iPS-kardiomyocytům volné kontrakce a omezuje jejich plnohodnotné zrání. Špatná biologická odpověď srdečních buněk se projevuje jejich přeměnou ve vazivo (fibroblasty) a ztrátou mechanické funkce. 
Primárním cílem práce je nalézt takový substrát, který by neomezoval kontraktilitu, zamezil přeměně a podporoval kardiomyocyty v růstu. Toho je možné dosáhnout pomocí nových nanomateriálů založených na bázi biopolymerů. Tyto materiály mají díky svému polymernímu základu a vysoké porositě výbornou elasticitu. Podporují tak růst dospělých srdečních buněk v animálním modelu. 
Zároveň je potřeba povrch upravit tak, aby co nejvíce připomínal vznikající srdeční tkáň. Modifikaci povrchu lze provést plasmochemicky, na povrch působí speciální druh nízkoteplotního elektrického plazmatu. Na ošetřených površích lze generovat funkční chemické skupiny, které zajistí hledanou biokompatabilitu. Plasmochemické reakce jsou pro vyšší efektivitu často kombinovány s klasickými chemickými reakcemi. Dalším cílem práce je adaptace povrchu substrátu tak, aby podporoval specializaci, růst, zrání a mechanickou funkci iPS-kardiomyocytů.
Třetím dílčím cílem je kultivace kardiomyocytů v zátěžových podmínkách (pod vlivem farmak a mechanického stresu) a sledování změn jejich funkčních vlastností. Na úrovni jednotlivých buněk lze kontrakce popsat s pomocí mikroskopie atomárních sil (AFM). Metodami molekulární biologie lze popsat změny strukturálních vlastnosti buněk a jejich metabolismu. Na úrovni jednotlivých kardiomyocytů tak můžeme sledovat mechanismy zapříčiňující v organismu srdeční selhání a hledat pro jeho terapii nová léčiva a terapeutické postupy.";CZ;;Academic

Vycházíme z předpokladu, že představy o důstojném umírání se ne vždy potkávají s žitou realitou. Závěrem života se rozumí období během posledního roku života pacienta/jednotlivce, který stoná nevyléčitelnou nemocí a/nebo umírá na stáří, - tj. o svém blížícím se konci života ví a vědomě se na něj (ne)připravuje.

Zejména budou i) studovány molekulární mechanismy zodpověděné za genetickou nestabilitu lidských embryonálních kmenových (hES) buněk a lidských indukovaných pluripotentních kmenových (hiPS) buněk, ii) budou testovány efekty biomimetických ligandů na kmenové a progenitorové buňky a budou vyvíjeny mikrofluidní přístupy a systémy ke kokultivaci více typů kmenových a progenitorových buněk, iii) bude zkoumána účast miRNA molekul na řízení diferenciace a ustavení plasticity kmenových buněk a iv) budou dále vyvíjeny protokoly diferenciace hES buněk do relevantních buněčných typů, zejména do odontogenní linie. Hlavními experimentálními přístupy budou in vitro manipulace s buňkami, zobrazování živých buněk i fixovaných buněk pokročilými mikroskopickými technikami, a také molekulární fenotypizace buněčných populací kvantifikací relevantních mRNA a proteinů.;CZ;;Academic

V uplynulých třech letech byl úspěšně realizován projekt OPTIMED s cílem plošně inovovat studijní program Všeobecného lékařství a významně tak posílit výuku orientovanou na řešení problémů v souladu s uplatněním absolventa v jeho další klinické nebo akademické praxi. V rámci projektu OPTIMED vznikla unikátní ICT platforma prezentující popis medicínského kurikula založená na metodice tzv. výstupů z učení. Předkládaný projekt EVAMED přímo navazuje na úspěšný projekt OPTIMED a přispěje tak dílčím způsobem k jeho udržitelnosti. EVAMED se ovšem zaměřuje hlavně na ICT technologie, pokročilou analýzu a vizualizaci dat, přičemž databázi OPTIMED chápe jako bohatý zdroj heterogenních dat. S ohledem na fakt, že na přípravě popisu výuky se podílelo více než 400 výukových specialistů a garantů je zřejmé, že granularita napříč obsahem portálu vykazuje vysokou variabilitu. Přirozená míra subjektivity autora-pedagoga při formulaci výstupů z učení i při specifikaci dalších popisných atributů studia rozdělila obsah portálu do různě formulovaných komponent – od obecných až po velmi detailně zaměřených. Primárním cílem projektu EVAMED je ve spolupráci se dvěma pracovními skupinami identifikovat prostřednictvím nově navržených metrik oblasti, které jsou ve své formalizaci nekonzistentní. S využitím nově vyvinutých evaluačních přístupů a metod pro vytěžování dat bude v navazujícím kroku možné efektivně zprostředkovat jasně uchopitelné výstupy autorům ve formě doporučení generovaných od zástupců pracovní skupiny. Hlavní snahou je tedy využít moderní přístupy k analýze heterogenních datových zdrojů za účelem sjednocení obsahu databáze OPTIMED, což povede ke zvýšení kvality popisu celého kurikula. Navržené a implementované metody hodnocení kvality a pro analýzu a vizualizaci dat mají vzhledem ke své unikátnosti velký publikační a citační potenciál, a to bez ohledu na konkrétní pilotní implementaci nad databází OPTIMED. Předpokládané výstupy z předloženého projektu EVAMED směřují k šíření know-how v oblasti optimalizace medicínského kurikula a vytěžování dat z edukačně zaměřených databází (EDM – educational data mining), a to nejen v prostředí lékařských fakult ČR a SR, ale také na mezinárodní úrovni.

Mutace v genu RECQ4 jsou spojeny s velmi závažným onemocněním Rothmund-Thomsonovým syndromem (RTS). RTS je autozomálně recesivní onemocnění, jehož klinickými příznaky jsou červená vyrážka (poikiloderma), oční zákal, kosterní defekty a vyšší náchylnost k rakovině kůže a kostí.  Avšak přesná role proteinu RECQ4 v metabolismu DNA zůstává dosud neobjasněna. Nicméně celá řada publikací ukazuje, že RECQ4 hraje velmi důležitou roli při udržování stability genetické informace a zároveň se podílí na její opravě. Výsledky z našeho laboratorního pracoviště naznačují, že RECQ4 protein by pravděpodobně mohl zastávat úlohu během rozkládání replikačních/rekombinačních meziproduktů, což je zásadní pro správnou segregaci chromozomů v průběhu mitózy, která je nesmírně důležitá pro další vývoj a život buňky. Naše studie tak přispěje k pochopení úlohy proteinu RECQ4 při nestabilitě genomu.;CZ;;

O zbývajících 20-30% hovoříme jako o epilepsiích farmakorezistentních. Farmakorezistenci lze (nikoliv dogmaticky) definovat jako nedosažení dlouhodobé bezzáchvatovosti za pomoci dvou dobře tolerovaných a vhodně zvolených antiepileptik (1). V takovém případě mají být vždy zváženy jiné (=nefarmakologické) terapeutické modality - v první řadě resekční epileptochirurgický výkon, v druhé řadě stimulace vagového nervu (VNS) a ketogenní dieta (KD). Právě KD zaznamenává v posledních letech významný rozmach v klinické praxi i vědecké sféře. Základní principy léčby jsou celosvětově prakticky totožné. Konkrétní léčebné protokoly se však v závislosti na pracovišti značně různí, a to zejména ve snaze o dosažení nejen maximální účinnosti, ale také maximální bezpečnosti léčby.

V českém překladu ji známe spíše pod pojmem hyperaktivita s poruchou pozornosti, případně hyperkinetická porucha. Nedostatečná schopnost soustředit se na vykonávání určité činnosti či zadaný úkol po delší časový interval může mít negativní dopad na průběh vzdělávání jedinců, u kterých byla tato porucha diagnostikována. Často ji provází specifické poruchy učení, mezi které řadíme dyslexii, dysgrafii, dyskalkulii a jiné. Cílem práce je zjistit, jakým způsobem ovlivňují individuálně volené chromagenové filtry pozornost u hyperaktivních dětí školního věku. K tomuto účelu bude použit test rychlosti čtení. Pro srovnání budou testovány také děti, u kterých se porucha nevyskytuje. V případě prokázání pozitivního vlivu barevných filtrů na soustředění a hyperaktivitu by mohlo jejich následné používání v praxi zjednodušit proces vzdělávání dětí s ADHD a vést ke zlepšení jejich studijních výsledků.;CZ;;

Hlavním cílem současného projektu je studium prostupnosti hemato-likvorové bariéry v plexus choroideus laterální a třetí mozkové komory po chronickém poškození periferního nervu.  
Na experimentálních modelech neuropatické bolesti laboratorního potkana bylo zjištěno, že v průběhu Wallerovy degenerace vznikají signální molekuly, které spouští zánětové reakce ve spinálních gangliích. Ty se projevují aktivací satelitních gliových buněk, invazí aktivovaných makrofágů a expresí pro- a protizánětlivých cytokinů a jejich receptorů nejen ve spinálních gangliích souvisejících s poškozeným nervem, ale i ve strukturách vzdálených segmentů. Šíření zánětové reakce do spinálních ganglií vzdálených míšních segmentů může probíhat krevní a/nebo likvorovou cestou. Naše dřívější experimenty prokázaly průnik značeného dextranu z likvoru a krve do spinálního ganglia, což prokazuje prostupnost hemato-nervové a likvor-nervové bariéry pro molekuly velikosti cytokinů (Joukal et al., 2013, 2014). 
Předpokládáme, že přes porušenou hemato-nervovou bariéru distálního pahýlu poškozeného nervu prostoupí signální molekuly do krevního oběhu a současně přes změněnou hemato-likvorovou bariéru do likvoru a tím ke vzdáleným strukturám nervové soustavy. Předpokládáme rovněž, že buňky plexus choroideus mohou po poškození periferního nervu reagovat produkcí dalších zánětových mediátorů sloužících k chemotaxi imunitních buněk a tím přispívat k šíření zánětové reakce do vyšších etáží centrální nervové soustavy.
Experimenty budou provedeny na 30 potkanech linie Wistar (samci, 250-300 g). Po provedení chronické konstrikce nervu budou zvířata přežívat 3 a 21 dnů. Následně bude intravenózně aplikován tracer (Floro-Emerald, MW=10 000). Po 18 hodinách bude odebrán mozek společně s mozkovým kmenem. Na kryostatových  řezech mozkových komor s plexus choroideus budou imunohistochemicky detekovány prozánětlivé cytokiny TNF-alpha, Il-6 a antigen prezentující buňky protilátkou MHC II. Buněčné spoje budou vizualizovány protilátkami proti ocludinu a claudinu. Získané preparáty budou vyhodnoceny ve fluorescenčním a konfokálním mikroskopu a intenzita imunofluorescence bude kvantifikována a statisticky srovnána s kontrolní skupinou zvířat (naivní) a se zvířaty po kožní incizi, ale bez poškození nervu (sham).";CZ;;Academic

První zmínka o anizometropii pochází ze 17. století. Rozlišujeme anizometropii hypermetropickou, myopickou, smíšenou a astigmatickou. Dále existuje i anizometropie latentní. Častou příčinou anizometropie je astigmatismus. Další příčinou může být např. keratokonus, jednostranný mikroftalmus, jednostranná afakie, zánětlivá onemocnění předního segmentu oka a různý stupeň katarakty. Přechodnou anizometropii také nalézáme u pacientů se systémovými chorobami. Může se objevit při horečnatých onemocněních, cukrovce atd. Nejčastějším typem anizometropie je anizometropie myopická, která se vyskytuje ve 40 % případů. Anizometropie o velikosti minimálně 2 D se vyskytuje minimálně u 20 % pacientů s refrakční vadou. Anizometropie o velikosti 2,5 D, tedy stav, kdy velikost retinálních obrazů se liší o 5 %, je obvykle hranicí pro binokulární vidění. Aniseikonie je spojena s anizometropií. Je to stav, kdy obraz předmětu vnímaného pravým a levým okem má nestejnou velikost a tvar. Při iseikonii jsou obrazy obou očí zcela shodné. Iseikonii můžeme dělit na dynamickou a statickou. Příčiny aniseikonie jsou optické a neoptické. Optické příčiny můžeme dělit na přirozené a uměle vyvolané. Mezi uměle vyvolané typy aniseikonie patří brýlová aniseikonie.

44964;1116/2014;New pharmacological mechanisms in preclinical and clinical drug development;Rudá Jana, doc.

Za tímto účelem využíváme několika přístupů, a to: i) ověřování a zpřesňování znalostí o mechanizmech účinku psychofarmak a identifikace jejich nežádoucích účinků (farmakodynamický přístup), ii) studium farmakokinetických vlastností psychofarmak (farmakokinetický přístup) a iii) studium dědičně podmíněné variability odpovědi organismu na podávání léčiv včetně možného epigenetického ovlivnění buněk v oboru cílené terapie v onkologii (farmakogenetický přístup). 
Farmakodynamické studie se soustřeďují především na identifikaci nových psychofarmak s antidepresivním, anxiolytickým a antipsychotickým potenciálem. Do skupiny studovaných léčiv patří kromě jiných ketamin jako potenciální rychle působící antidepresivum. Slibným zdrojem pro vývoj nových antipsychotik je endokanabinoidní systém v mozku, který ovlivňuje další neurotransmiterové systémy, např. dopaminergní, serotonergní, glutamátergní. Mezi studované nežádoucí účinky patří především vliv antipsychotik, ale i schizofrenii podobného fenotypu (animální modely), na rozvoj metabolického syndromu a hladiny adipokinů.
Farmakokinetické studie se zaměřují na aktivitu jednoho z nejdůležitějších biotransformačních enzymatických systémů, cytochromu P450 (CYP). Metabolická aktivita CYP je ovlivněna mnoha faktory, jako jsou pohlaví, věk, genetický polymorfismus a xenobiotika. Interindividuální rozdíly v aktivitě CYP, způsobují odlišnou rychlost metabolizace léčiv mezi jednotlivými pacienty a mohou hrát významnou roli v bezpečnosti a účinnosti podávaných látek. Stanovení vlivu používaných i potenciálních léčiv na aktivitu tohoto metabolického systému je nezbytné pro dosažení bezpečné a účinné farmakoterapie. Farmakogenetické studie se soustředí na hledání souvislostí mezi variabilitou odpovědi na cílená protinádorová léčiva a expresí vybraných biomarkerů. Tyto jsou studovány především na úrovni epigenetických mechanismů (mikroRNA), které regulují jejich expresi. Změny v expresi mikroRNA jsou zkoumány také v kontextu možného farmakologického ovlivnění. Hlavními cíli celého projektu je přispět k výzkumu a vývoji nových léčiv a zlepšit stávající klinické rozhodování v indikacích nákladné cílené terapie. Projekt využívá analýz klinických dat i validované animální modely.";CZ;;Academic

Proto je nezbytné hledat způsoby, jak zvýšit kapacitu motorického učení. Tento projekt je inovativní, protože jeho záměrem je poprvé ukázat, že vedle senzorické stimulace (vizuální vodítka, rytmus) můžeme významně zlepšit kapacitu procedurálního učení tím, že zvýšíme angažovanost a motivaci pacientů v daném úkolu pomocí sociální interakce a smysluplných cílů. Za tímto účelem budeme srovnávat výkon v klasickém laboratorním úkolu testujícím implicitní učení s výkonem v ekologicky validnějším úkolu, kde využijeme počítačovou hru podobnou Guitar Hero. Výsledky tohoto výzkumu mohou přispět k rozvoji nefarmakologických intervencí v terapii PN.;CZ;;Academic

Aktivace granulocytů u nemocných s primárními imunodeficienciemi
Předpokládaný zdroj financování: AZV
Polymorfonukeární granulocyty hrají důležitou roli v obransychopnosti těla proti řadě mikrobů. Aktivace granulocytů tak může být nejen přímým následkem interakce makroorganismu s mikrobem, ale také výsledkem řady imunopatologických stavů, na nichž se primárně mikrobiální podnět může, ale i nemusí podílet. Mezi tyto imunopatologické stavy můžeme zařadit i primární imunodeficience a to primární hypogamaglobulinémie a hereditární angioedém.
Typickými zástupci onemocnění primární hypogamaglobulinémií je běžený variabilní imunodeficit (CVID). Je důležité, že u pacientů s CVID jsou přítomny serologické známky možné bakteriální translokace vyjádřené vzestupem sérové hladiny sCD14, stejně jako sCD25, vyjadřujícího především možnou aktivaci monocytů a T-lymfocytů. To vše nás vede k otázce o stupni aktivace granulocytů u nemocných s CVID a šířeji s vrozenými agamaglobulinémiemi.
Kromě aktivace granulocytů je u pacientů s CVID možné vystopovat možné známky supresorové aktivity granulocytů a monocytů. Ta je asociována s nově popsanou subpopulací  granulocyte-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSC) a monocyte-myeloid-derived suppressor (MO-MDSC). 
Dalším onemocněním ze skupiny primárních imunodeficiencí, kde leze předpokládat aktivaci granulocytů je hereditární angioedém. Podstatou tohoto onemocnění je kvantitativní nebo kvalitativní porucha inhibitoru C1 (C1-INH). Nedostatek tohoto regulačního proteinu vede k neregulované aktivaci nejen komplementové kaskády, ale i hemokoagulačního, fibrinolytického a kininového systému. Řada produktů všech těchto systémů má také aktivační vliv na polymorfonukleární  i monocytární buňky. 
Pracovní hypotéza: 
Aktivace granulocytů je přítomna u nemocných se závažnými protilátkovými imunodeficity stejně jako u nemocných s hereditárním angioedémem. Aktivce granulocytů u nemocných s CVID se spolupodílí na vzniku imunopatologických fenoménů, zejména na vzniku sekundárního imunodeficitu v oblasti T-lymfocytů.    
Stanovit stupeň aktivace granulocytů a monocytů u nemocných s CVID a HAE, jak ve „klidovém“ stavu, tak po podání intravenózní  imunoglobulinové léčby (u nemocných s CVID), nebo při atace HAE.";CZ;;Academic

Národní infrastruktura CZECRIN je zformována pod vedením Masarykovy univerzity jako příjemce a Fakultní nemocnice u sv. Anny v Brně (FNUSA) jako dalším účastníkem projektu. Podstatou infrastruktury CZECRIN je úzká spolupráce mezi akademickými, výzkumnými a klinickými pracovišti, jež je reflektována i v organizaci a organizační struktuře. Základními stavebními jednotkami jsou Univerzitní a Klinický modul. Univerzitní modul řídí metodickou podporu, koordinaci a nezávislý monitoring klinického hodnocení, sběr, uchování a analýzu klinických dat a edukaci v oblasti klinického hodnocení, současně je nositelem výzkumných aktivit v předmětné oblasti. Masarykova univerzita je národním kontaktním bodem s napojením na mezinárodní konsorcium ECRIN-ERIC. Univerzitní modul je synergicky doplněn modulem Klinickým, který je metodicky řízen FNUSA, jehož klíčovou funkcí je identifikace pacientů naplňujících kritéria klinického hodnocení se zvláštním zřetelem na méně časné diagnózy vyžadující širokou kooperaci zdravotnických zařízení. Další funkcí Klinického modulu je implementace standardů klinického hodnocení v legislativním kontextu ČR a praktické provedení klinického hodnocení. Oba moduly společně zajišťují interakci s regulatorními orgány ČR. Infrastruktura tímto pokrývá oblast celé České republiky a je schopna zajistit přípravné, prováděcí i kontrolní činnosti při provádění akademických klinických hodnocení a klinických studií teoreticky v jakékoliv fázi i jakékoliv odbornosti.

Ačkoli některé významné kroky směrem k jejich klinické aplikaci již byly učiněny, stále je mnoho překážek, které je nutno překonat. Jednou z nejvýznamnějších je riziko genetických změn in vitro propagovaných SC.

Pro sebeobnovu potřebují hPSC aktivní signalizaci receptoru pro fibroblastový růstový faktor (FGFR). Pokud není FGFR signalizace aktivní, hPSC ztrácejí pluripotenci a zvyšují apoptózu.
Dříve jsme prokázali, že exogenní FGF2 zvyšuje klonogenní kapacitu a potlačuje apoptózu. Současně hPSC syntetizují vlastní FGF2; jeho nízkomolekulární izoforma je sekretována a předpokládá se její autokrinní/parakrinní efekt na sebeobnovu. Avšak existence takovéto smyčky nebyla jasně prokázána a její další úloha ve fyziologii hPSC je nejasná. V procesu sekrece FGF2 bylo popsáno několik molekul; doposud známými intracelulárními regulátory jsou ATP1A1, TEC a Translokin/CEP57. Existence těchto molekul nebyla u hPSC popsána. Naše předběžné výsledky však indikují, že přinejmenším TEC je v hPSC exprimován.

Direct reprogramming process involves lineage conversion by transient induction of cellular plastic state, leading to epigenetic erasure of cell identity that is permissive to lineage switch upon specific stimulus. Since the direct reprogramming does not revert cells to pluripotency, it does not harbor safety concerns typical for pluripotent stem cells, thus holds the great promise in regenerative medicine. However, the direct reprogramming is achieved by introduction of exogenous genes, which still limits the practical application of this technique. The general aim of this project is to remove this limitation using microRNA manipulation. In this project we will identify microRNA molecules, that are crucial for the induction of cellular plasticity and we will test, whether manipulation with these microRNA can lead to direct reprogramming of somatic cells into neural lineage.;CZ;;Academic

Studie bude probíhat na třech úrovních: buněčná kultura, izolovaný orgán (srdce), zvíře (myš a/nebo potkan). Experimenty budou prováděny na zdravých a nádorových (karcinom prsu) modelech. Velký důraz bude kladen na studium kardiotoxicity. Kromě jiného bude stanovena cytotoxicita indukovaná DOX, farmakokinetika, poškození DNA, oxidační stres a srdeční funkce. Účinky každé formy DOX budou studovány a porovnány s pozitivní (konvenční DOX) a negativní (vehikulum) kontrolou a mezi sebou navzájem.;CZ;;Academic

Aberantní aktivace FGFR může vyvolat onemocnění. Aktivující mutace FGFR3 jsou genetickou příčinou trpaslictví u člověka, tj. achondroplazie a tanatoforické dysplázie. Prodloužená aktivace MAP kinázy ERK, která je zprostředkována adaptorovým proteinem FRS2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2), je hlavním článkem, přispívajícím k efektu mutantní formy FGFR3; avšak molekulární mechanismus tohoto fenotypu není znám. Podobně tak u lidských pluripotentních kmenových buněk (hPSC), a to jak embryonálních (hESC) tak indukovaných (hiPSC), je aktivace ERK po aktivaci FGFR prodloužená, což podporuje nediferencovaný stav a pluripotenci těchto buněk. Dynamika interakce FRS2 s FGFR, ERK a dalšími asociovanými proteiny je klíčem k pochopení molekulárního mechanismu aberantního FGFR3 signálování ve skeletálních dyspláziích a také fyziologické funkce FGFR signalizace v sebeobnově a pluripotenci hPSC.";CZ;;Academic

Věnujeme se dvěma otevřeným otázkám vztahujícím se k mikrostruktuře a martenzitickým transformacím B2-R-B19’: (i) proč atomy vodíku stabilizují B2 a R mřížky a potlačují odpovídající transformaci do martenzitu B19’ a (ii) jak atomy kyslíku a/nebo vodíku ovlivňují precipitaci Ni4Ti3 a tím následnou transformaci ve variantách slitin bohatých Ni. Tato témata mají úzký vztah ke křehnutí NiTi superelastických stentů během jejich dlouhodobých expozic in-vivo. Proto je pozornost rovněž věnována změnám struktury a vlastností slitin NiTi vystavených komponentám in-vivo prostředí. Bude-li projekt řešen, očekáváme následující výsledky: (i) objasnění mechanismu kterým intersticiální příměsi ovlivňují mikrostrukturu a následnou dráhu martenzitické transformace, (ii) mikrostrukturní scénář, který vysvětlí křehnutí superelastických NiTi komponent v podmínkách in-vivo prostředí.;CZ;;Academic

Z toho důvodu je potřeba zavést minimálně invazivní markery z periferní krve, které by mohly být častěji sledovány. V poslední době byly popsány v souvislosti s onemocněním sérové cirkulující mikroRNA a volně cirkulující DNA nesoucí IGHV přesmyk specifický pro patologické plazmatické buňky MM. Naším cílem je studovat dynamiku těchto dvou typů molekul v séru MM na základě hypotézy, že jejich kombinace by se mohla stát markerem MM a nastávajícího relapsu. Proto budeme sledovat hladiny zvolených mikroRNA a volně cirkulující DNA u pacientů s MM v době diagnózy a v různých časových bodech v průběhu prvních dvou let od stanovení diagnózy, a tyto hladiny budeme korelovat se současně používanými markery MRD. Vzájemná kombinace těchto molekul poskytne nové možnosti pro minimálně invazivní monitorování nemoci.;CZ;;Academic

U monoklonální gamapatie nejasného významu a mnohočetného myelomu patrně dochází k tomu, že významná over-exprese genu pro cyklin D1 je redundantní a nevede k progresi buněčného cyklu z důvodu klidového stavu většiny maligních buněk. Je tedy pravděpodobné, že po proběhnutí kompletní maligní transformace již nelze rozhodující kontrolní bod buněčného cyklu G1/S regulovat deterentními mechanismy a potenciálně zvýšenou hladinou cyklinů D vedoucí ke kompletní mitóze. Proto předpokládáme, že exprese sady genů s aktivačním účinkem na buněčný cyklus je v dynamické rovnováze se sadou genů zodpovědných za jeho inhibici a slouží tak jako kompenzační mechanismus. Avšak akumulace karcinogenních událostí v průběhu progrese do plazmocelulární leukémie vede k tomu, že kontrola buněčného cyklu pomocí těchto inhibitorů není dostatečná a vede k překonání restrikčních bodů v průběhu mitózy.;CZ;;

Bylo také zjištěno, že miRNA jsou úzce spojeny s fyziologií lidských embryonálních kmenových (EK) buněk a pravděpodobně sehrávají důležitou roli v regulaci jejich dvou klíčových vlastností - sebeobnově a schopnosti diferencovat se. Důležité je, že zachování pluripotence a sebeobnovy lidských EK buněk úzce souvisí s regulací průchodu buněk buněčným cyklem. Jakou roli v tomto propojení hrají miRNA není přesně popsáno. Cílem tohoto projektu je tedy studovat úlohu miRNA v řízení diferenciace lidských EK buněk do neurálních kmenových buněk (NKB). Předpokládáme, že některé miRNA, jejichž hladina se specificky zvyšuje s diferenciací, regulují buněčný cyklus a neomezený růstový potenciál u NKB. Předběžná data ukazují některé miRNA se zvýšenou expresí u NKB (př. miR-21, miR-221, miR-125, a j.) patří do skupiny tzv. „oncomiR“ a byly asociovány s různými druhy rakoviny.

Termín „personalizovaná medicína“ se užívá již koncem minulého století, nicméně její rozvoj je patrný od počátku 21. století, zejména v souvislosti s dokončením sekvenace lidského genomu. S poznáním genomu a se zavedením nových technologií je koncept personalizované medicíny vztažen především k možnostem uzpůsobit navrženou farmakoterapii konkrétnímu jedinci na základě molekulárně-genetického testování. Specifickou kapitolou v rámci personalizované farmakoterapie jsou pak léčivé přípravky (LP) pro moderní terapii, kam řadíme přípravky genové či somatobuněčné terapie nebo přípravky tkáňového inženýrství. S rozvojem této oblasti medicíny se debatuje o regulaci těchto přístupů a s tím související zásadní otázky etické.

Odlišnost moderních terapií přesahuje současný rámec právní a regulační úpravy. Je nutné řešit otázky v oblasti zajištění jejich kvality a bezpečnosti, stejně jako otázky jejich dostupnosti pacientům. Navrhovaný výzkumný projekt si klade za cíl zmapovat a zhodnotit regulační rámec léčiv pro personalizovanou terapii.

Projekt bude rozdělen do tří tematických celků. Jsou jimi: (I) vývoj nových léčiv, (II) jejich výroba a uvádění na trh a (III) použití ve zdravotní péči.  Výzkum v rámci každého celku bude rozdělen do tří fází. V první fázi budou provedeny studie o současném stavu každé oblasti v České republice, v Evropě a ve světě. Druhá fáze projektu bude analyzovat výstupy předchozí fáze za účelem reflexe stávající regulace, identifikace oblastí s nedostatečnou či nadbytečnou regulací. Třetí fáze spočívá v publikování dosažených poznatků.

Vedle teoretických výstupů bude praktickým přínosem projektu zejména formulace národních doporučení (metodiky, best practices) pro správní úřady, etické komise, zadavatele klinických hodnocení, poskytovatele zdravotních služeb a výzkumné instituce včetně Masarykovy univerzity.";CZ;;employee, academic

Farmakologicky velmi zajímavými skupinami rostlinných alkaloidů jsou benzofenantridinové alkaloidy, které se vyznačují hlavně svými protinádorovými účinky, a kanabinoidy, jenž lze využít například pro léčbu deprese a úzkosti, neurodegenerativních onemocnění a dalších vážných onemocnění mozku. Obě tyto skupiny alkaloidů poskytují proto velmi cennou inspiraci pro návrh a vývoj léčiv.
Vlastní proces vývoje nových léčiv je však i v současné době velkou výzvou pro výzkumné instituce i pro komerční společnosti. Tento proces zahrnuje návrh struktury léčiva pomocí chemoinformatických metodik, jeho syntéza a jeho laboratorní testování (t.j, analýza jeho interakcí s cílovými biomakromolekulami, testování na buněčných a tkáňových kulturách, in vivo testy).  Díky možnosti vytvoření mezioborového projektu v rámci MU a zapojení výzkumných týmů s kvalitní expertízou v požadovaných oblastech se nám otevírá prostor na tuto výzvu reagovat. 
Hlavním cílem našeho projektu je nalézt dosud neprozkoumané biologicky aktivní molekuly ze skupiny benzofenanthridinů a kanabinoidů. Vybrané z těchto látek pak plánujeme zakoupit nebo syntetizovat a provést s nimi laboratorní testy. 
Velmi důležitým cílem našeho projektu je také zpřístupnit jednotlivé komponenty procesu návrhu a testování léků léků a jiných biologicky aktivních substancí dalším pracovištím MU. Pro tyto účely rovněž plánujeme připravit software a IT prostředí, sloužící k provádění chemoinformatických analýz rostlinných alkaloidů.
Při realizaci projektu využijeme hlubokou expertízu v oblasti benzofenantridinových alkaloidů (LF, Biochemický ústav) a v oblasti kanabinoidů (CEITEC, Centrum neurověd). Dále začleníme pokročilou expertízu v oblasti chemoinformatických metodik (CEITEC, Centrum Strukturní biologie) a v oblasti IT (ÚVT). Poté využijeme rozsáhlé zkušenosti z oboru organické syntézy (PřF, Ústav chemie) a z oboru analýzy biomolekulárních interakcí (PřF, NCBR a Ústav chemie). Na závěr využijeme pokročilé know-how v oblasti testování na buněčných kulturách (LF, Biologický ústav), na tkáňových kulturách (CEITEC, Centrum neurověd) a in vivo (CEITEC, Centrum neurověd).";CZ;;

Malá část těchto nádorů však v rozporu s teoretickou prognózou časně metastazuje do lymfatických uzlin, což je prvním krokem směřujícím k delokalizaci nádorového  onemocnění. V současné době existuje urgentní klinická potřeba nalezení vhodného diagnostického přístupu, který by umožnil selektovat skupinu pacientek s vyšším rizikem metastazování a indikovat vhodnou agresivnější terapii, která by snížila riziko relapsu onemocnění. Za tímto účelem bude analyzován klinickopatologicky charakterizovaný soubor 48 low-grade nádorů prsu pomocí pokročilých přístupů systémové biologie: Analýzy transkriptomu sekvenováním nové generace, pomocí SWATH proteomiky a s využitím digitální patologie. Budou rovněž hledány proteiny na povrchu nádorové buňky vhodné jako cíle biologické terapie. Získaná data budou následně analyzována jednak unimodálně (zpracování dat jednoho typu), jednak multimodálně. Pro konstrukci unimodálních a multimodálních prediktivních modelů budou použity lineární a nelineární klasifikátory. Modely budou přizpůsobeny pro „screening“ (tedy vysoká senzitivita) i pro „diagnózu“ (vysoká senzitivita i specificita) a testovány jednak samostatně, jednak jako součást možného hierarchického rozhodovacího systému. Pro klinickou praxi bude vybrán model nebo systém modelů, který se ukáže jako nejvhodnější nejen z hlediska přesnosti predikce, ale i z hlediska jednoduchostí implementace.

Ve velké většině zahrnují jejich projevy srdeční selhání. Výzkum procesu selhání mechanické srdeční funkce na buněčné a molekulární úrovni lze sledovat a modelovat již na jednotlivých srdečních buňkách. Kardiomyocyty lze bez zásahu do srdeční tkáně získat diferenciací z indukovaných pluripotentních kmenových buněk (iPS). Srdeční buňky tak vyrůstají a tepají v laboratorní misce, stačí malý kousek kůže dárce. Pokud je dárcem člověk s dědičným onemocněním srdce, lze u jeho srdečních buněk sledovat mechanické a elektrické projevy.
Růst na běžných površích však nedovoluje iPS-kardiomyocytům volné kontrakce a omezuje plnohodnotné zrání. Špatná biologická odpověď srdečních buněk se projevuje jejich přeměnou ve vazivo (fibroblasty) a ztrátou mechanické funkce.
 
Primárním cílem práce je nalézt takový substrát, který by neomezoval kontraktilitu, zamezil přeměně a podporoval kardiomyocyty v růstu. Toho je možné dosáhnout pomocí nových nanomateriálů založených na bázi biopolymerů. Tyto materiály mívají díky svému polymernímu základu a vysoké porositě výbornou elasticitu. Podporují tak růst dospělých srdečních buněk v animálním modelu.
 
Zároveň je potřeba povrch upravit tak, aby co nejvíce připomínal vznikající srdeční tkáň. Modifikaci povrchu lze provést plasmochemicky, na povrch působí speciální druh nízkoteplotního elektrického plazmatu. Na ošetřených površích je možné generovat funkční chemické skupiny, které zajistí hledanou biokompatabilitu. Plasmochemické reakce jsou pro vyšší efektivitu často kombinovány s klasickými chemickými reakcemi. Dalším cílem práce je adaptace povrchu substrátu tak, aby podporoval specializaci, růst, zrání a mechanickou funkci iPS-kardiomyocytů.
 
Třetím dílčím cílem je kultivace kardiomyocytů v zátěžových podmínkách (pod vlivem farmak a mechanického stresu) a sledování změn jejich funkčních vlastností. Na úrovni jednotlivých buněk lze kontrakce popsat s pomocí mikroskopie atomárních sil (AFM). Metodami molekulární biologie lze popsat změny strukturálních vlastnosti buněk a jejich metabolismu. Na úrovni jednotlivých kardiomyocytů můžeme tak sledovat mechanismy zapříčiňující v organismu srdeční selhání a hledat pro jeho terapii nová léčiva a terapeutické postupy.";CZ;;Academic

Nejčastějším vedlejším efektem je enormní únava a nevýkonnost, která provází pacienta obvykle od začátku onemocnění, zhoršuje se v průběhu terapie a často přetrvává i roky po jejím úspěšném ukončení. Jedna z hlavních příčin této únavy pramení ze snížené celkové zdatnosti (=dekondice), která je dána zpravidla negativní změnou poměru aktivní tělesné hmoty vůči tukové složce a poklesu pohybové aktivity (PA). Ukazuje se, že únava provázející maligní onemocnění má úzký vztah k celkové aktivitě autonomomního nervového systému (ANS), zejména k aktivitě vagu. Spektrální analýzou (SA) variability srdeční frekvence (HRV) lze neinvazivně posoudit funkční stav ANS. Je známo, že pravidelné cvičení zvyšuje jednak tělesnou zdatnost, jednak způsobuje pozitivní změny ANS, a to jak u zdravých, tak i u nemocných osob. Přestože existují nepochybné důkazy o pozitivním vlivu PA na celkový průběh řady onkologických onemocnění, je překvapivé, že i v rámci odborné podpůrné péče není vůbec doporučována, mnohdy jsou nemocní dokonce přímo odrazováni. Aplikaci PA u hematoonkologických pacientů, kteří tvoří v rámci onkologie specifickou podskupinu nemocných, ztěžuje výrazné postižení produkce krevních elementů poruchy krevního srážení a také snížení výkonnosti imunitního systému. Dosavadní těžiště léčby HON leží výlučně v podání různě agresivní chemoterapie a nemocní tak tvoří z hlediska možnosti fyzického tréninku značně heterogenní populaci. Z tohoto důvodu je velmi žádoucí fundovaný prospektivní  klinický interdisciplinární výzkum, na jehož základě by bylo možno vytvořit směrnice pro preskripce programu PA, které by bylo možno implementovat do standardních klinických postupů. Fyzický trénink je sice na pohled velmi logickou a bezproblémovou intervencí, bezpečné převedení této myšlenky do rutinní klinické praxe je však velmi obtížný úkol. Na jeho řešení je bezpodmínečná úzká spolupráce jak specialistů hematoonkologů tak specialistů v oboru fyzioterapie i tělesné výchovy a sportu. Cílem projektu je kromě tvorby tréninkových guidelines i přímé ovlivnění chorobého procesu, tedy o jakousi formu podpůrné ""léčby pohybem"".";CZ;;Academic

MikroRNA (miRNA) jsou nedávno identifikované molekuly RNA, které se uplatňují jako zásadní intracelulární mediátory procesů, které se účastní adaptace na pohybovou aktivitu, včetně angiogeneze, zánětu, mitochondriálního metabolismu, tvorby kontraktilní síly v srdečním/kosterním svalů a svalové hypertrofie. I když cirkulující molekuly miRNA (c-miRNA) byly studovány jako biomarkery u řady onemocnění, chybějí údaje definující úlohu c-miRNA v podmínkách akutní tréninkové zátěže i dlouhodobého tréninku u zdravých osob a není známa jejich korelace s hladinami mikroRNA v moči a slinách.

Tento přístup zatím nebyl v historické antropologii (paleopatologii) aplikován. Integrace těchto metod do paleoonkologie by měla umožnit přesnou a jednoznačnou diagnostiku u nádorů primárně diagnostikovaných prostřednictvím diferenciální diagnostiky nebo pomoci zúžit interval možných nádorových typů. U metastáz by zavedení těchto metod mělo pomoci určit primární lokalizaci nádoru. Cílem interdisciplinárního výzkumu je modifikace v současnosti využívané metodiky v medicínském výzkumu a klinické praxi tak, aby byla použitelná u fragmentované a degradované historické DNA a aby se tento typ diagnostiky mohl stát běžnou součástí paleopatologického studia nádorových onemocnění u historických populací. 
Výsledky molekulárně biologické a paleopatologické analýzy kostry postiženého jedince budou dále propojeny s poznatky současné klinické praxe, bude proveden pokus o rekonstrukci možného průběhu onemocnění na základě analogií s průběhem nemocnění u současných pacientů a jeho frekvencí v recentní populaci.

Léčba stafylokokových infekcí je komplikovaná častým výskytem kmenů rezistentních na antibiotika. Zejména meticilin-rezistentní kmeny Staphylococcus aureus, hojně rozšířené v nemocničních zařízeních, představují celosvětově závažný zdravotnický problém. Bakteriofágy mohou být využity jako alternativní terapeutika bakteriálních infekcí, zejména kmenů rezistentních proti antibiotikům. Kvůli chybějící legislativě související se schválením fágů jako léčiv, v žádném ze států Evropské Unie, USA, ani ostatních vyspělých zemí není na trhu dostupný fágový preparát k léčbě lidských bakteriálních infekcí.

V rámci předkládaného grantu plánujeme studovat jaké klinické kmeny S. aureus je fág 812K1-420 schopen infikovat. Srovnáním kmenů S. aureus rezistentních a citlivých k fágu 812K1-420 budeme schopni identifikovat buněčné receptory pro fága.

Na zachycení vlivu vybrané meditační techniky pro pacienta budou sloužit klinické kardiologické vyšetření, stanovení kortizolové křivky jako ukazatele stresu, test na zjištění přítomnosti spánkové apnoe a dotazník zaměřený na kvalitu života jedince. Pacienti se zúčastní rehabilitačního programu na Interní kardiologické klinice FN Brno, do něhož budou integrovány meditační dechové a vizualizační techniky s cílem sledovat jejich dlouhodobý vliv na kardiovaskulární činnost a následné zlepšení života pacienta po IM. Zhodnocení vlivu sugesce na efektivitu meditačních technik předpokládá větší odezvu na prováděnou, meditací inspirovanou techniku. Výsledky projektu povedou ke zlepšení a inovaci rehabilitace pacientů po IM a umožní jejich rychlejší návrat do normálního života. Zároveň také ověří použitelnost meditačních technik v kardiologické praxi kontrolovaným experimentem.

Poruchy čtení, dyslexie, jsou nečastější specifickou poruchou učení. Jedná se o receptivní poruchu založenou na neschopnosti charakterizovat písmena a slova a dekódovat psaný text. Protože dyslexie je založena na jazykových schopnostech pacienta, léčba se řídí touto etiologií. Trénink spočívá v nácviku rozpoznávání písmen, slov a nácviku čtení. Většina léčebných programů je velmi individuální a zapojuje se do ní mnoho odborníků – psychologů, pediatrů, logopedů, pedagogů, oftalmologů, optometristů. I role rodičů je velmi důležitá, zejména v kontrole cvičení a motivaci. V současné době není k dispozici adekvátní statistická evidence vizuální a behaviorální optometrie, proto tyto techniky nejsou v odborných kruzích doporučovány. Naším cílem je u vybraných jedinců se specifickými poruchami učení aplikovat některé metody vizuální a behaviorální terapie za účelem zlepšení a eliminace symptomů specifických poruch učení. Jedince budeme vybírat na základě doporučení pracovníků pedagogicko-psychologických poraden.

Nicméně  není potvrzeno, že inhalační aerosolová terapie vede ke zvýšení rezistence HME filtrů a neexistuje konsenzus kam umístit v okruhu filtr během inhalační terapie. 
Cíl: Cílem je zhodnotit změnu odporu HME filtrů umístěných v dýchacím okruhu po aplikaci nebulizovaných léků během umělé plicní ventilace.
Metoda :Rezistence filtru bude měřena na mechanickém modelu umělé plicní ventilace. Rezistence bude vypočtena jako změna tlaku na filtru vydělená průtokem.
Analýza dat: Budou srovnány rezistence měřené za různých podmínek: bez a s aerosolovou terapií, s aerosolovou terapii s lékem a aerosolovou terapií bez léku, při použití různých HME filtrů, různých léků a typů dýchacích okruhů a umístění HME v okruhu.

Zdokonalením prošly nejen zobrazovací metody užívané při navigaci - ultrazvuk, skiaskopie, výpočetní tomografie, magnetická rezonance, ale rovněž paralelně s nimi i techniky endovaskulární či intratumorální léčby. V současnosti jsme schopni aplikovat lokoregionální chemoterapii, provádět chemoembolizaci s drug eluting beads.  Punkčními technikami jsme schopni provádět RFA, MW ablace, ireverzibilní elektroporace. Kombinací metod lokální tumor destrukce a cíleného podání chemoterapeutika se protinádorový účinek díky synergii může znásobit.
Onkologické intervence (nyní jako zásadní a samostatná část intervenční radiologie) jsou postupy miniinvazivní s nízkou mírou komplikací.  Konkurentem tumor destrukčních výkonů navigovaných obrazem jsou otevřené chirurgické postupy. Konkurentem lokoregionální aplikace chemoterapeutik nebo chemoembolizace je systémová aplikace léčiv, zejména biologické terapie.  I když srovnáním protinádorového efektu onkologických intervencí se zabývají mnohé publikace, ve světové literatuře jsou jen částečné informace o farmakoekonomické efektivitě těchto specifických metod léčby.   
Náš projekt je zaměřený na vyhodnocení onkologických intervencí prováděných na našem pracovišti v celém spektru solidních tumorů včetně farmakoekonomických aspektů. Cílem je porovnat cost-efectiveness onkologických intervenčních metod se standardní široce dostupnou onkologickou léčbou. Vedlejším cílem je vypracování místních postupů a standardů při užití těchto specifických metod. Součástí projektu je zhodnocení i některých intervenčních metod, které nejsou terapeutické, ale zcela zásadně se spolupodílí včetně obrazové diagnostiky na léčbě pacienta (např. perkutánní biopsie, choledochoskopie, 3D navigace ultrazvukem naváděných intervencí). Využití těchto moderních metod může zpřesnit a urychlit dosažení výsledků, ale stejně může být i jen zdrojem dodatečných nákladů pro zdravotní systém.  
Projekt přímo navazuje na projekt specifického výzkumu řešeného v roce 2011 na naší klinice v rámci projektů Lékařské fakulty Masarykovi univerzity, kde přínos radiologických diagnostických a terapeutických metod byl srovnáván s nežádoucími účinky ionizujícího záření.";CZ;;Academic

Tento léčebný přístup zdůrazňuje systematické užití znalostí o nádorovém onemocnění a jednotlivci  k výběru a optimalizaci terapie. V současnosti čelíme v dětské onkologii skutečnosti, že jsou dostupné desítky a v blízké budoucnosti stovky protinádorových preparátů, jejichž mechanismus účinku je biologický, tj. cíleně zasahuje konkrétní terapeutický terč.

Jedním z cílů časopisu je naučit studenty sebevzdělávání i z jiné literatury než jsou odborná skripta, učebnice, atlasy a další. Dalším cílem je připravit studenty psát odborné i populárně naučné články. Toto je zvlášť důležité v dnešní elektronické době, kdy jsou lidé zvyklí hledat informace na internetu. Každý rok jsou také zpracovány desítky odborných témat v rámci diplomových a bakalářských prací. Ačkoli jsou tyto práce dostupné v plném znění na internetu, měli by studenti ovládat schopnost jejich prezentace odborné i laické veřejnosti v celostátních časopisech.

Zisk velkého množství buněk, potřebných pro buněčnou terapii nebo modelování chorob, vyžaduje dlouhodobou kultivaci v podmínkách in vitro. Nicméně v předchozím výzkumu bylo zjištěno, že během dlouhodobé in vitro kultivace se výrazně snižuje aktivita bázové excizní reparace (BER), díky snížení exprese apurinní/apyrimidinní endonukleázy 1 (APE1), a následně se tak zvyšuje frekvence mutací a destabilizuje genom. V naší hypotéze předpokládáme, že kvůli snížené aktivitě BER nedochází k vytvoření dostatečného množství dvouřetězcových zlomů (díky seskupenému poškození bází) a tím dochází k nedostatečné aktivaci kontrolního bodu G1/S. Poškození bází proto proniká dále v buněčném cyklu. Toto poškození by mělo vyvolat zástavu replikační vidlice a aktivovat homologií rekombinaci (HR). Zvýšená frekvence mutací u LEKB z pozdní pasáže a buněk s downregulovanou/inhibovanou APE1 však napovídá, že i mechanizmus HR by u buněk z pozdní pasáže mohl být méně aktivní, než u pasáže časné. Aby bylo možné v budoucnu cíleně zvýšit genomovou stabilitu dlouhodobě kultivovaných LEKB, je nejdříve zapotřebí analyzovat a porozumět mechanizmům HR a kontrolních bodů zodpovědných za eliminaci poškození genomu.

Senioři se po překonání určitých typů zdravotních komplikací dožijí životního údobí, kdy se začínají kumulovat choroby, narůstá počet užívaných medikamentů, kompenzační mechanismy slábnou. Důsledkem je postupný vznik stařecké křehkosti s častými dekompenzacemi zdravotního stavu a postupnou ztrátou soběstačnosti. Cílem projektu je definovat závažnost jednotlivých předpokládaných rizikových faktorů ztráty soběstačnosti a sestavit profylaktická opatření pro její zachování. Další řešenou oblastí projektu jsou možnosti primární prevence těchto syndromů, tedy ovlivnění výskytu metabolického syndromu, osteoporózy a sarkopenie, demencí a depresí v populaci maldších věkových skupin, přičemž doba pro primární prevenci některých těchto syndromů začíná již ve druhém životním deceniu;CZ;;Academic

Hlavním cílem projektu je zavedení termovizní techniky v praxi jako další metody pro hodnocení revaskularizace dolních končetin a zapojení této techniky jako eventuální rovnocenné náhrady ke klinickým metodám Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) či stanovení transkutánní tenze kyslíku (TcpO2).
Dalším záměrem je využití termovizních kamer jako diagnostických nástrojů u nejasných případů onemocnění a následné léčby, kde právě v kombinaci se zavedenými metodami může snadno a téměř s nulovou zátěží pro pacienta indikovat postižené místo a pomoci tak lékaři k nastavení vhodného léčebného postupu, což vede ke zkvalitnění péče o pacienta. Realizace projektu má vést k zavedení termovizní techniky do oblasti vyšetření diabetických i nediabetických pacientů, v tomto konkrétním případě zejména s ohledem na prováděné operativní revaskularizace na pracovišti II. chirurgické kliniky FN u sv. Anny a LF MU v Brně.
Specifita projektu je dána přímou spoluprací klinického a teoretického pracoviště, kdy je diagnóza pacienta stanovena či několika metodami. Unikátním je právě propojení termografických zařízení se stanovením transkutánní tenze kyslíku (TcpO2). Přístroj pro stanovení transkutánní tenze kyslíku byl pořízen v tomto roce na základě společného požadavku obou pracovišť (Biofyzikální ústav a II. chirurgická klinika) a s předpokladem společného využití při další spolupráci.

Farmakokinetické studie se zaměřují na aktivitu jednoho z nejdůležitějších biotransformačních enzymatických systémů, cytochromu P450 (CYP). Metabolická aktivita CYP je ovlivněna mnoha faktory, jako jsou pohlaví, věk, genetický polymorfismus a xenobiotika. Interindividuální rozdíly v aktivitě CYP, způsobují odlišnou rychlost metabolizace léčiv mezi jednotlivými pacienty a mohou hrát významnou roli v bezpečnosti a účinnosti podávaných látek.

Je způsoben deficitem inhibitoru C1-esterázy (C1-INH), následkem opakovaných atak aktivace komplementového, ale i kininového systému jsou opakující se otoky v podkoží a v podslizničních tkáních s následnou klinickou manifestací. 

První část projetu je zaměřena na zodpovězení otázky do jaké míry jsou u nemocných s HAE aktivovány polymorfonukleární granulocyty, což by bylo možné předpokládat, přesto doposud nebylo popsáno. Budou sledovány plasmatické hladiny produktů granulocytů a snad též přítomnost znaků aktivace granulocytů pomocí průtokové cytometrie

V genetické části studie se zaměříme na otázku, proč jsou u nemocných trpící touto chorobou s dominantní dědičností (tj. přítomností jedné divoké alely) hladiny C1-INH v séru na úrovni 5-30% běžných hodnot zdravé populace. K tomuto účelu budeme sledovat expresi C1-INH v buněčných kulturách (pomocí real-time PCR) a její ovlivnění přídavkem samotného C1-INH nebo jeho interakčních partnerů. Dále ověříme vztah mezi množstvím mRNA a proteinu C1-INH v krvi zdravých dárců a podle možností také u dobrovolníků z řad pacientů s HAE. 

Současně budou sbírána data o klinické prezentaci HAE a zejména o zpoždění stanovení diagnózy u těchto nemocných a vývoji tohoto diagnostického zpoždění v posledních 30 letech. Tato studie by měla dokumentovat jak se zlepšilo povědomí o této nemoci, která, pokud není správně rozpoznána, může vést ke smrti nemocného udušením nebo závažnou akutní příhodou břišní.

Hlavním cílem současného projektu je prostorová vizualizace vztahu arachnoidey, mikrovaskularizace a spinálních ganglií laboratorního potkana s využitím projasňovací techniky „CLARITY“ (Chung et al., 2013), imunohistochemických technik a konfokálního mikroskopu. 
Na experimentálních modelech neuropatické bolesti laboratorního potkana bylo zjištěno, že v průběhu Wallerovy degenerace vznikají signální molekuly, které spouští zánětové reakce ve spinálních gangliích. Ty se projevují aktivací satelitních gliových buněk, invazí aktivovaných makrofágů a expresí pro- a protizánětlivých cytokinů a jejich receptorů nejen ve spinálních gangliích souvisejících s poškozeným nervem, ale i ve strukturách vzdálených segmentů. Šíření zánětové reakce do spinálních ganglií vzdálených míšních segmentů může probíhat krevní a/nebo likvorovou cestou. Naše dřívější experimenty prokázaly průnik značeného dextranu z likvoru a krve do spinálního ganglia, což prokazuje prostupnost hemato-nervové a likvor-nervové bariéry pro molekuly velikosti cytokinů (Joukal et al., 2013). 
Předpokládáme, že subarachnoideální prostor vyplněný likvorem dosahuje do těsné blízkosti spinálních ganglií a dává anatomický podklad pro šíření molekul z likvoru do spinálního ganglia. Současně také předpokládáme, že uspořádání mikrovaskularizace spinálního ganglia z radikulárních cév a jejich vztah k likvorovému prostoru dává morfologický základ pro šíření molekul krevní cestou.
Experimenty budou provedeny na 20 potkanech linie Wistar (samci, 250-300 g). Po odběru spinálních ganglií společně s kořeny míšního nervu a segmentu míchy bez poškození obalů míšních a cévního zásobení bude provedeno jejich projasnění metodou „CLARITY“. Na projasněných preparátech bude imunohistochemickou detekcí DPP-IV vizualizována arachnoidea limitující subarachnoideální prostor.

Na buněčné úrovni zinečnaté ionty ovlivňují proliferaci, buněčnou diferenciaci, apoptózu a autofagii. Velmi významně se zinečnaté ionty uplatňují v řadě patologií, mimo jiné i v patogenzi tumorů prostaty. Prostatické buňky jsou svým vztahem k zinečnatým iontům unikátní. Fyziologicky dochází v prostatě až k desetinásobné akumulaci těchto iontů. Nádorově změněná tkáň však schopnost akumulace zinku postrádá a jeho koncentrace se výrazně snižuje. Tento projekt je zaměřen na odhalení vlivu zinečnatých iontů na viabilitu, životní funkce a výživu zvířat a dále na testování zinek rezisteních prostatických nádorových linií a jejich migrační a invazivní potenciál.

Na rozdíl od jiných deubikvitinačních enzymů, které se podílí na regulaci Mdm2, není stabilizace Mdm2 zprostředkovaná USP48 spojena se změnou úrovně ubikvitinace, což naznačuje, že probíhá nekanonickým mechanismem nezávislým na deubikvitinaci. V jiných, podobných experimentech jsme zjistili, že některé proteiny z rodiny MAGE (z angl. Melanoma-associated antigens) dokáží ovlivnit hladinu onkogenu MdmX v buňce. Vysoká exprese proteinů obou rodin, USP i MAGE, se může podílíet na kancerogenezi a navrhovaný projekt by měl přispět k porozumění mechanismům, které se podílí na zvýšení hladiny Mdm2 a MdmX působením proteinů USP48 a MAGE a určit jejich úlohu v inhibici aktivity p53 v nádorových buňkách.;CZ;;academic, student

Tato odpověď funguje jako složitá síť, ve které paralelně spolupracují alternativní a často redundantní dráhy. Nedávné studie ukázaly, že částečné narušení této sítě v nádorové buňce vede k závislosti buňky na jediné DNA opravné dráze. Toho lze potenciálně využít při hledání terapie, která je cíleně zaměřená na dráhy zapojené v DDR. Znalost redundance těchto drah může být obzvláště důležitá u nádorových buněk, kde je možné využít přístup tzv. „syntetické letality“ (SL).

Z pohledu naší univerzity je projekt příležitostí k nastavení a implementaci zcela nového přístupu v procesu TT, který dosud na Masarykově univerzitě nebylo možné realizovat. Projekt cílí na podporu přímé spolupráce výzkumníků a pracovníků v oblasti TT a umožňuje tak vytvořit společnou „komercializační strukturu“ pro každou klíčovou aktivitu projektu. To představuje významný zvrat v procesu řízení a realizace TT aktivit na MU, kdy lze mnohem efektivněji usměrňovat nejen zdokonalování vybraných výstupů - vytvoření Proof of Concept (PoC), ale s mnohem větší podporou a zájmem výzkumníků realizovat činnosti související s komercializací těchto výstupů. Díky projektu tak dojde nejen k efektivnímu využití již zavedené a funkční struktury pro transfer technologií na MU (existující  CTT, jehož vybrané aktivity jsou do r. 2015 podporovány z projektu OP VaVpI 3.3. „TT na MU“), ale k jejímu významnému systémovému i funkčnímu rozvoji.

Projekt BioTechMed umožňuje realizovat činnosti TT na MU v daleko širším měřítku, než doposud. Proces TT může oproti současnosti probíhat kontinuálně (přípravná fáze, ověření konceptu vč. ochrany dušev. vlastnictví, marketingové strategie, příprava komercializace aj.) a plně za účasti a v souladu se zájmy výzkumného pracoviště. 

Realizace projektu přináší vybraným výzkumným týmům nesmírně důležité posílení důvěry v činnosti, které mohou vést k uplatnění jejich výstupů v praxi. Několik unikátních a nadějných výstupů dostává jedinečnou šanci, k tomu, aby směřovaly k reálnému využití.

Ve své nejčastější formě lze autismus považovat za komplexní, multifaktoriální onemocnění, determinované interakcí genetického pozadí jedince s faktory vnějšího prostředí. Geny v dopaminergních drahách obecně představují vynikající kandidátní geny pro multifaktoriální formu PAS, protože dopaminergní dráhy modulují motorické funkce, kognitivní procesy (včetně exekutivních funkcí) a učení a účastní se regulace emocí, což jsou všechno oblasti u autismu určitým způsobem narušené.
Předpokládáme, že genetická variabilita v dopaminergních drahách představuje důležitý faktor genetické vnímavosti pro komplexní formu PAS a citlivosti dítěte vůči vlivům blízkých sociálních vztahů (vyjádřených formou a kvalitou interakce rodič-dítě), jednak pro specifické nutriční chování konkrétního jedince, které bývá u autismu také typické.
Cílem projektu je sledovat u kohorty cca 100 pacientů s PAS, u nichž byl vyloučen syndrom fragilního X a jiné běžně testované genetické choroby,  souvislost mezi cca 30 definovanými polymorfismy v 9 genech kódujících důležité prvky dopaminergních drah (SLC6A3, DBH, TH, TYR, PTS, PAH, COMT, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) a stanovit, zda tyto polymorfismy mají význam z hlediska stratifikace pacientů vzhledem k závažnosti autismu, kognitivním schopnostem dítěte, senzitivitě vůči trestu a odměně, senzitivitě vůči odmítnutí, iniciativě rodiče v interakci s dítětem a nutričním zvyklostem dítěte s PAS.

Problémem správné diagnostiky lymeské borreliózy je nízká spolehlivost sérologických testů a z ní vyplývající nízká specificita laboratorní diagnostiky.
Falešně pozitivní výsledky vedou k tomu, že pacienti trpící nemocemi s podobnými symptomy mohou být nesprávně léčeni. Naopak v některých případech, kdy lékař správně vyhodnotí, že pacient touto nemocí netrpí a potíže souvisejí spíše s jiným onemocněním nebo jsou psychosomatického nebo imunologického rázu, pacient diagnózu neakceptuje a vzniká mezi ním a lékařem napětí. Hlavním cílem předkládaného projektu je řešit diagnostiku v širších souvislostech pomocí týmu odborníků z řad strukturních biologů, lékařů z infekčních klinik, imunologů, praktických lékařů, bioinformatiků, statistiků, ale také psychologů a sociologů. V projektu chceme využít jedinečnou možnost nabízené platformy Masarykovy univerzity sdružující zúčastněné týmy. 
Cílem projektu je zpřesnění procesu při stanovení diagnózy v dimenzi biologické, ale také psychologické a sociální. Je třeba, aby si pacient v návaznosti na jeho osobní situaci vytvořil pozitivní vazbu důvěry ke svému zdravotnickému zařízení, aby nabyl jistoty, že péče, které se mu dostává je komplexní a nejlepší, jakou může dostat.

Předpokladem hlubšího porozumění patogenezi epilepsie je získání komplexnějších dat o těchto změnách, což vyžaduje propojování poznatků a metod věd o živé i neživé přírodě. Tento projekt proto staví na spolupráci epileptologů, molekulárních biologů a odborníků na nanotechnologické senzory a navazuje na již probíhající výzkum neurodegenerativních onemocnění. Synergie těchto týmů umožní získat unikátní výsledky s vysokým publikačním, klinickým a komerčním potenciálem.
Moderní klinická i experimentální epileptologie usiluje zejména o objasnění fenoménu farmakorezistence, jež by otevřelo cestu vedoucí k novým diagnostickým a terapeutickým postupům. Součástí diagnostického postupu u farmakorezistentní epilepsie bývá invazivní vyšetření pomocí intracerebrálních EEG elektrod monitorujících elektrofyziologickou aktivitu mozku. Inovativním záměrem tohoto projektu je nanotechnologická modifikace těchto elektrod, která při téže míře invazivnosti umožní detektovat také elektrochemický korelát elektrofyziologické aktivity. 
V průběhu výzkumu využívajícího experimentální animální model farmakorezistentní epilepsie budou sledovány neurotransmitery (acetylcholin, kys. glutámová, kys. gama-aminomáselná, glycin, dopamin, serotonin, tyrosin, tryptofan) a peptidy (proteiny) s agregační funkcí.";CZ;;employee, academic

Téma inkluze bude řešeno jako interdisciplinární problém, což umožní řešitelům jeho komplexní uchopení bez limitu oborovosti. Inkluzivní vzdělávání není jen problémem pedagogickým nebo speciálněpedagogickým, ale týká se celé řady vědních oborů – psychologie, lékařství a sociologie. Výzkumný projekt bude řešen nově vzniklým konsorciem šesti spolupracujících výzkumných týmů ze tří fakult MU (PdF, LF a FF). Zaměříme na vzdělávací politiku a kritické analýze podrobíme relevantní národní a mezinárodní dokumenty a další zdroje. Dále nás bude zajímat perspektiva organizačně řídící – budeme se věnovat strategiím řízení školy jako instituce a organizace, ve které inkluze probíhá. Pedagogicko-didaktické hledisko uplatníme v další části výzkumu. V této oblasti se zaměříme na výchovu a vzdělávání žáků se speciálními vzdělávacími potřebami v základní škole. Z perspektivy speciálněpedagogické budeme zkoumat možnosti inkluze žáků s narušenou komunikační schopností, se sluchovým, mentálním, tělesným a kombinovaným postižením. V rámci zkoumání inkluze ve škole z hlediska medicínského se budeme věnovat zdravotním předpokladům a kompetencím žáků z perspektivy teoretické i klinické medicíny. Při zkoumání psychologických aspektů inkluze budou předmětem zkoumání souvislosti inkluze a kvality života. V rámci sociologické perspektivy budeme zkoumat sociální participaci jedinců se zdravotním postižením jako indikátor úspěšné inkluze.
Interdisciplinární výzkum inkluze ve škole nebyl v českém prostředí dosud proveden. Činnost výzkumných týmů nebude probíhat izolovaně, ale využijeme řady mezioborových synergií. Výsledkem bude komplexní poznání toho, jaké podmínky je nutné vytvořit pro úspěšné inkluzivní vzdělávání. Ve výše uvedeném spatřujeme také inovativnost a originalitu projektu.
Výzkumným prostředím budou běžné základní školy realizující inkluzivní vzdělávání. Využijeme standardní postupy sociálně vědního a medicínského výzkumu. Výsledky budeme prezentovat v kolektivních monografiích (7), v předních odborných časopisech (12) a v řadě výstupů na významných národních a mezinárodních konferencích.

Nejčastějším vedlejším efektem je enormní únava, která provází pacienta obvykle od začátku onemocnění, zhoršuje se v průběhu terapie a může přetrvávat i roky po jejím úspěšném ukončení. Jedna z hlavních příčin této únavy pramení ze snížené celkové zdatnosti (=dekondice), která je dána zpravidla negativní změnou poměru aktivní tělesné hmoty vůči tukové složce a poklesu pohybové aktivity (PA), ať již v důsledku onemocnění jako takového nebo agresivní terapie. Ukazuje se, že únava provázející maligní onemocnění má negativní vztah k celkové aktivitě autonomního nervového systému (ANS), zejména k aktivitě vagu. Spektrální analýzou (SA) variability srdeční frekvence (HRV) lze neinvazivně posoudit funkční stav ANS. Je známo, že pravidelné cvičení zvyšuje jednak tělesnou zdatnost, jednak způsobuje pozitivní změny ANS, a to jak u nemocných, tak i u zdravých osob. Přestože existují nepochybné důkazy o pozitivním vlivu PA na celkový průběh řady onkologických onemocnění, je překvapivé, že i v rámci odborné podpůrné péče není příliš doporučována. Aplikaci PA u hematoonkologických pacientů, kteří tvoří v rámci onkologie specifickou podskupinu nemocných, ztěžuje výrazné postižení produkce krevních elementů poruchy krevního srážení a také snížení výkonnosti imunitního systému; dosavadní těžiště léčby leží výlučně v podání chemoterapie. Z těchto důvodů jsou v současné době k dispozici pouze velmi obecné pokyny k preskripci pohybové aktivity a rehabilitace u pacientů s HON. Z tohoto důvodu je velmi žádoucí další klinický interdisciplinární výzkum, na jehož základě by bylo možno vytvořit směrnice pro preskripce programu PA, které by bylo možno implementovat do standardních klinických onkologických postupů. Výzkum této oblasti a tvorba bezpečných a účinných tréninkových programů představují poměrně složitý mezioborový úkol, jehož řešení se systematicky věnuje i ve světě pouze několik málo pracovišť.

V klinické praxi jsou KRAS mutantní nádory tlustého střeva považovány za homogenní skupinu nádorů. V současnosti se však objevují přímé i nepřímé, důkazy o jejich heterogenitě a to nejen v reakci na léčbu, přežití ale i v genové expresi (Popovici et al., 2012; Budinska et al., 2012). Pochopení buněčných procesů zodpovědných za tyto rozdíly je rozhodující pro výzkum potenciální cílené léčby. Studium genové exprese, v kombinaci s klinickými parametry a parametry o přežití je v praxi rutinně využíváno pro odhalení nových biomarkerů a cílů pro potencionální terapii, a je jednou z technik používaných pro odhalení biologických procesů specifických pro jednotlivé nádory. Zatím neexistuje studie, která by se na heterogenitu KRAS mutatních nádorů cíleně zaměřovala z hlediska genové exprese.
Hlavním cílem této diplomové práce je explorace heterogenity KRAS mutantních nádorů z hlediska genové exprese a korelace této heterogenity se známými a současně používanými klinickými a histopatologickými parametry, specifickými molekulárními determinanty nádoru kolorekta a přežitím.

I přes obrovský pokrok v léčbě MM většina pacientů relabuje. Minimální residuální choroba (MRD, minimal residual disease) je stav, kdy u pacientů v klinické remisi stále přetrvávají klonogenní buňky, jejichž proliferace vede ke klinickému relapsu. Současné přístupy pro zhodnocení přítomnosti nádorových buněk jsou založeny na morfologickém hodnocení vzorku kostní dřeně a elektroforetických metodách. Většinou standardních metod jsou tyto klonogenní buňky nezachytitelné, ale včasný záchyt by měl přímý vliv na přežívání pacientů. V současné době se k detekci MRD využívá flow cytometrie a PCR, které mají uplatnění pro zjištění účinnosti léčby, porovnání efektivity různých léčebných strategií, monitorování pacientů a relapsu onemocnění. Detekce MRD pomocí PCR využívá amplifikace tumor-specifického molekulárního markeru. U MM je tímto markerem přestavba těžkého řetězce imunoglobulinu, kdy sekvence hypervariabilní oblasti tohoto imunoglobulinu slouží pro návrh primerů a sond specifických pro pacienty, které jsou pak v následné PCR reakci schopny detekovat přítomnost MRD s citlivostí až 10-6.

K diagnostice ASS by mohl napomoci nový biomarker quiescin Q6 a NGAL. K detekci a časné predikci AKI by mohl napomoci biomarker NGAL a k objasnění rozvoje aseptické zánětlivé reakce by mohl být využit biomarker pentraxin 3. Všechny tři studované biomarkery by mohl být užitečné k predikci střednědobé prognózy. Studovaná populace bude zahrnovat 800-1000 pacientů s AKS, kteří podepsali informovaný souhlas s účastí na projektu. Ze vzorku krve odebraného při přijetí budou stanoveny výše uvedené biomarkery. Využitelnost quiescinu Q6 a NGALu k diagnostice ASS bude hodnocena ve srovnání s hodnotou BNP, prediktivní hodnota NGALu k časné detekci AKI bude srovnána se vstupního hodnotou kreatininu a význam pentraxinu 3 bude srovnáván s hodnotou CRP a prokalcitoninu. V projektu bude vyhodnocena krátkodobá 30 denní a střednědobá roční prognóza zahrnující celkovou mortalitu, reinfarkt, hospitalizaci pro srdeční selhání, cévní mozkovou příhodu. Výstupem bude kritické zhodnocení praktické využitelnosti těchto markerů v klinické praxi, event. zařazení těchto biomarkerů do algoritmů odborných doporučení. Na projektu bude spolupracovat mimo Interní kardiologické kliniky FN Brno i Ústav patologické fyziologie a Biochemický ústav.

Základním cílem projektu v roce 2013 bude studium šíření signálních molekul z distálního pahýlu poškozeného nervu, které mohou vyvolat vznik neurozánětu ve vzdálených struktur nervové soustavy. Z našich a publikovaných experimentálních výsledků klinických studií vyplývá, že po poškození periferního nervu vznikají projevy neurozánětu ve spinálních gangliích, kořenech spinálních nervů a následně i zadních rozích šedé hmoty míchy. Zánětlivé reakce ve vzdálených nervových strukturách mohou výrazně přispívat k vytvoření dysbalance v aferentaci, která je považována za jeden z mechanizmů vzniku neuropatické bolesti.
Předpokládáme, že přes porušenou hemato-nervovou bariérou se signální molekuly dostanou do cirkulující krve a přes hemato-likvorovou bariéru do likvoru a tím ke vzdáleným nervovým strukturám. Naznačenou cestu lze ověřit v experimentu po přerušení n. ischiadicus laboratorního potkana za sterilních podmínek pomocí značených molekul-tracerů. 
Po aplikaci tracerů (FluoroRubu, FluoroEmerald, fluorescein sodný, ) do n. ischiadicus bude proximálně provedeno jeho přerušení za vzniku Wallerovy degenerace v distálním segmentu nervu, při které po 3 až 7 dnech dochází k otevření hemato-nervové bariéry. Distribuce tracerů bude sledována fluorescenčním mikroskopem ve spinálních gangliích a míšních segmentech L4-L5, které anatomicky souvisí a také v segmentech C7-C8, které nemají anatomické spojení s n. ischiadicus. Dále bude distribuce tracerů sledována v buňkách krevního nátěru a v plexus choroideus komor CNS. Aktivace gliových buněk a invaze buněk imunitního systému bude sledována imunohistochemickou detekcí odpovídajících buněčných markerů (GFAP, OX42, ED1) v odebraných vzorcích nervové tkáně z experimentálních zvířat.";CZ;;Academic

Projekt se zabývá: 1. Sledováním aktivity ES v animálních modelech metamfetaminové závislosti a deprese jako její komorbidity; 2. Rolí ES v regulaci metabolické aktivity cytochromu P450 a dopady na farmakokinetiku léčiv. Depresivní onemocnění je spojováno s vyšší vulnerabilitou k látkovým závislostem. Proto byla popsána teorie tzv. sebeléčení jako možné vysvětlení časté komorbidity deprese a drogové závislosti, kdy se pacient pokouší ulevit depresivním příznakům užíváním návykové látky. Náš tým za účelem zkoumání vzájemných interakcí deprese a drogové závislosti vyvinul a validoval animální (potkaní) model této komorbidity, kde je depresivní onemocnění navozeno modelem olfaktorické bulbektomie a metamfetaminová závislost metodou operantní autoaplikace. Tento model je určen k testování léčiv a experimentálních látek, u nichž existuje racionální podklad pro hypotézu možného ovlivnění průběhu drogové závislosti. Dalším významným faktorem ovlivňujícím účinek návykových látek jsou farmakokinetické vlastnosti a interakce drog, případně změna jejich farmakokinetiky vyvolaná endokanabinoidní regulací. Cytochrom P450 (CYP) patří mezi nejdůležitější biotransformační enzymatické systémy. Metabolická aktivita CYP je ovlivněna mnoha faktory, jako jsou pohlaví, věk, genetický polymorfismus a xenobiotika. Interindividuální rozdíly v aktivitě CYP, způsobují odlišnou rychlost metabolizace léčiv mezi jednotlivými pacienty a mohou hrát významnou roli v bezpečnosti a účinnosti podávaných látek. Podle nejnovějších údajů je metabolická aktivita CYP regulována také centrálním mechanismem skrze ovlivnění dopaminergního systému.

Tyto abnormality se často vyskytují u genů, které byly identifikovány v genetických (často celogenomových) studiích jako rizikové pro vznik a/nebo rozvoj diabetu a s ním souvisejících pozdních komplikací (např. diabetická nefropatie). Výsledkem epigenetických změn (případně jejich kombinace s genetickými změnami) je změněný fenotyp příslušné buňky. Naše výzkumná skupina identifikovala genetickou variabilitu v promotoru RAGE genu jako rizikový faktor diabetické nefropatie. Tato asociace byla později prokázána i v dalších populacích. Předpokládáme, že podobně jako jiné prozánětlivé geny je i exprese genu RAGE regulována také pomocí epigenetických mechanizmů.

Proto se jejich léčba koncentruje do center, která jsou pak schopna na základě interdisciplinární spolupráce zajistit nesrovnatelně lepší výsledky.
I.ortopedická klinika LF MU, FN u sv.Anny v Brně je v současné době  jediné pracoviště v České republice zabývající se komplexní terapií kostních nádorů a kde pravidelně pracuje společný tým z obou brněnských fakultních nemocnic a Masarykova onkologického ústavu. 
 Z celkového počtu pacientů operovaných pro zhoubný kostní nádor na končetině je 30% indikováno k amputaci  a 70% k operaci zachovávající končetinu .
Při operacích zachovávající funkční končetinu můžeme pro náhradu kostního defektu po odstraněném kostním nádoru použít buď kostní štěp z tkáňové banky nebo některý z typů individuální tumorózní endoprotézy. Zhoubné kostní nádory se  vyskytují nejvíce v druhém a třetím deceniu a proto operujeme kostní nádory i u dětí.  Zde pak řešíme problém diference délek končetin, který se projeví během růstu dítěte.
Jednou z možností je vývoj tzv.“rostoucí endoprotézy“. Tato endoprotéza implantovaná do kosti dítěte umožní  (mechanicky ,či na jiném principu) pozvolný růst této kosti do délky a tím i růst cév,nervů a svalů příslušné končetiny a to až do dospělosti. Poté se endoprotéza odstraní a nahradí se definitivní tumorozní endoprotézou nebo kostním homoštěpem.
Protože se maligní kostní nádor vyskytuje nejčastěji v oblasti kolenního kloubu (cca v 50%), je v popředí naší pozornosti vývoj a zhotovení „rostoucí endoprotézy“ distálního konce stehenní kosti. Výhodou projektu je, že autoři  mohou navázat na zkušenosti  získané u „rostoucí endoprotézy“ pažní kosti a na spolupráci původních řešitelů. Nevýhodou jsou naprosto jiné požadavky na zátěž a lokomoci dané endoprotézy v oblasti  kolenního kloubu.";CZ;;Academic

EKG, kontinuální záznam krevního tlaku, sfygmografický záznam) a vícerozměrných (ultrazvuk) signálů. Jednou z otázek, kterou může tato studie zodpovědět je, zda snížená schopnost baroreflexní regulace krevního tlaku (BRS) u hypertoniků je primární či sekundární. Předpokládáme, že hlavně u mladých hypertoniků může převládat genetická determinace, jejíž podíl se postupně s věkem hypertoniků bude zmenšovat. Naopak u starší populace bude pravděpodobně snížená BRS hlavně sekundárního původu a to z důvodu ztráty poddajnosti arteriální stěny, kde se nacházejí baroreceptory. S hodnocením tuhosti tepen a hypertenzí jsou v poslední době úzce spojovány parametry odvozené z centrální aortální křivky (CABP). Bohužel tyto parametry jsou odvozovány složitými matematickými přepočty z křivek periferních tepen s pravděpodobnosti zanesení chyby. Proto neninvazivní stanovení centrální CABP přímo z aorty je velmi žádoucí.

HS;01.02.2013;31.12.2015;Recipient;GA ČR / Standard projects;LF;Department of Pathological Physiology;Mnohočetný myelom (MM) je maligní onemocnění diferencovaných B-lymfocytů, pro které jsou charakteristické translokace zahrnující oblast pro těžký řetězec imunoglobulinu, a také četné a komplexní chromozomální abnormality. Prvotní příčina nádorové transformace vedoucí k MM není známá, nicméně je patrné, že opětovné vstoupení B-lymfocytů do buněčného cyklu a jeho progrese nastává v rané fázi onkogeneze a je příčinou expanze monoklonálních myelomových buněk.  Byly popsány dvě rané dráhy patogeneze MM, hyperdiploidní (HRD) a nonhyperidloidní  (NHRD). Obě dráhy vedou v konečném důsledku ke genetickým aberacím cyklinů D, které následně deregulují G1/S bod restrikce, jenž je v myelomových buňkách často poškozen. Umlčení exprese genů pro cykliny D pomocí shRNA spojené s profilováním genové exprese a následná systematická analýza signálních drah umožní stanovení účinku cyklinů D na skupinu genů a následné odlišení genů regulovaných přímo cykliny D od sekundárních jevů.;CZ;;

Toto nádorové onemocnění je charakterizováno špatnou prognózou a mediánem přežití 12 až 15 měsíců. Řešitelský tým zde navrhuje unikátní přístup - kombinaci standardní léčby, zahrnující chirurgickou resekci nádoru, radioterapii a podávání temozolomidu, s vakcinací dendritickými buňkami (DB) silně produkujícími interleukin (IL)-12. V navrhované akademické klinické studii fáze II budou pacienti randomizováni v poměru 1:1 do skupiny se standardní léčbou, nebo do skupiny se standardní léčbou a vakcinací DB. Hlavním cílem projektu je zhodnotit bezpečnost a případnou toxicitu takovéto kombinované léčby, a vyhodnotit potenciál DB pro navození dlouhodobé remise onemocnění. DB jsou připravovány v Čistých prostorách Masarykovi university, jediném akademickém pracovišti v České republice, které má povolení Státního ústavu pro kontrolu léčiv k výrobě DB pro klinické použití. Tento projekt je unikátní jak v České republice, tak v Evropě, protože u GBM kombinuje standardní léčebný postup s moderním přístupem buněčné imunoterapie. Vakcinace dendritickými buňkami produkujícími IL-12 jako součást kombinované terapie by se do budoucna mohla stát novým standardem v léčbě GBM, a případně i dalších typů nádorových onemocnění.

Prvotní experiment Spemanna a Mangoldové z roku 1924 prokázal, že neurální indukce je řízena výhradně vnějšími faktory. Tato výchozí hypotéza předpokládá, že ektodermální buňky automaticky podstupují neurální diferenciaci při nepřítomnosti vnějších inhibitorů. Dodnes se však neví, zda to platí. Existují i vnitřní faktory? Mají vnitřní faktory na neurální indukci rozhodující vliv? Na tyto otázky musíme nalézt odpověď.

Projekt bude zaměřen na zobrazovací metody využívající ultrazvuk (ultrasonografie, včetně dopplerovského zobrazování), laser (např. optická koherenční tomografie), elektromagnetické záření v infračervené oblasti spektra (termografie), elektromagnetické záření ve viditelné oblasti spektra (např. endoskopie, dermatoskopie), elektromagnetické záření v oblasti spektra rádiových vln (magnetická rezonanční tomografie), elektrické vlastnosti tkání (elektrická impedanční tomografie, EKG a EEG mapování) a elastické vlastnosti tkání (elastografie). Část tématu bude věnována principům vzniku obrazu, hodnocení a posouzení kvality obrazu a obrazovým artefaktům.

    Sadu výukových materiálů budou tvořit elektronické texty, prezentace a návody k praktickým úlohám. Multimediálními učebními pomůckami budou obrazová schémata, nákresy, počítačové animace, modely a video ukázky jednotlivých zobrazovacích metod. Všechny výstupy projektu bude možné využít samostatně nebo je bude možné zahrnout do e-learningových kurzů.

    K prezentaci výstupů projektu budou sloužit nově vytvořené webové stránky projektu. Projekt bude prezentován rovněž v rámci projektu pro podporu a rozvoj výuky medicínských oborů s využitím moderních informačních a komunikačních technologií MEFANET (http://www.mefanet.cz/), dále v podobě stručných článků na webových stránkách projektu Wikiskripta (http://www.wikiskripta.eu) a také na sociálních sítích (např.

Na Biofyzikálním ústavu LF MU máme více než dvacetileté zkušenosti s termovizní technikou, avšak prozatím je k dispozici pouze průmyslová termovize s mikrobolometrickým detektorem, jež je využívána zejména pro demonstrační praktickou výuku a práci studentů a jejíž rozlišení prostorové i teplotní je poměrně nízké. Tato technika však neumožňuje řadu aplikací a má poněkud omezené možnosti z hlediska vlastních měření studentů. Tyto nedostatky odstraňují nové termovize s kvantovými chlazenými detektory v kombinaci s více licencemi zpracovatelského software. Tyto chlazené termovize umožňují větší rozlišení (cca 100krát lepší), větší rychlost snímání obrazů (softwarové a hardwarové nástroje umožňují zobrazit až desetitisíce snímků za sekundu) a také umožňují při mikroskopickém zobrazování rozlišení na úrovni mikrometrů. Zvláštní výhodou bezkontaktní termografie je rychlost měření a přenositelnost systému, což umožňuje velkou variabilitu realizovatelných praktických úloh a experimentální práce studentů pregraduálních i postgraduálních.

Základní úrovní této spolupráce je vytvoření odborných sítí mezi lékařskými fakultami v ČR, jako platformy výzkumné, vzdělávací a interaktivní, jež by byly základem pro kontaktní místa při spolupráci v oblasti KDP. Druhý stupeň spolupráce je na úrovni odborných lékařských společností, jejichž interaktivní komunikace při kontinuální tvorbě KDP hraje významnou roli. Třetí stupeň spolupráce podnikatelský, jež na základě komunikace s první i druhou úrovní spolupráce aplikuje KDP do konkrétní praxe konkrétních nemocnic. Informace o klinických doporučených postupech jsou však cyklické, kdy na implementaci a evaluaci klinických doporučených postupů navazuje další proces jejich změny, je nutné uvedenou spolupráci mezi všemi zúčastněnými institucemi stále udržovat.

Základním cílem projektu v roce 2012 je studium aktivace gliových buněk, invaze makrofágů a exprese vybraných pro- a protizánětlivých cytokinů a jejich receptorů v kořenech spinálních nervů na experimentálních modelech poškození periferního nervu. Z publikovaných experimentálních a klinických studií vyplývá, že po poškození periferního nervu vznikají projevy neurozánětu ve spinálních gangliích a zadních rozích míchy, zatímco minimálně informací máme o těchto reakcích v kořenech spinálních nervů. Přitom kořeny spinálních nervů propojují spinální ganglia s míchou a jejich mechanické poškození nebo jen kontakt s vyhřezlým ncl. pulposus meziobratlové ploténky vyvolává u člověka intenzivní bolestivé stavy (sciatica). Lze proto předpokládat, že projevy neurozánětu po poškození periferního nervu, které se šíří do spinálních ganglií a dorzálních rohů míchy se budou projevovat i v míšních kořenech a mohou výrazně přispívat k vytvoření dysbalance v aferentaci, která je považována za jeden z mechanizmů vzniku neuropatické bolesti. 
Experimentální modely poškození nervu, které všeobecně slouží ke studiu jak regenerace axonů, tak vzniku neuropatické bolesti, jsou založeny na unilaterálním položení dvojité ligatury na n ischiadicus laboratorního potkana za sterilních podmínek.

Nová molekulárně typizační metoda (TP0136/TP0548/23S rDNA) identifikovala v ČR 9 různých genotypů T. pallidum. Vyšetření treponemální DNA ze vzorků, získaných na základě spolupráce česko-argentinského týmu, tak kromě údajů o genetické variabilitě T. pallidum ověří také diskriminační schopnosti nového genotypizačního systému TP0136/TP0548/23S rDNA.;CZ;;Academic

Sporadický OC představuje heterogenní skupinu nádorů s různou histologickou stavbou, odvozenou většinou z epitelu ovariálního povrchu. Karcinom prostaty (PCa) je nejčastějším nádorovým onemocněním mužského urogenitálního traktu, kde obvykle vzniká ze žlázového epitelu prostaty. Klinické projevy rozvoje nádorového postižení ovarií i prostaty jsou nespecifické a pozdní záchyt onemocnění výrazně komplikuje terapii a snižuje délku přežití. Stávající diagnostické a prognostické faktory využívané k odhadu vývoje onemocnění, zpřesnění diagnózy a optimalizaci klinických intervencí zahrnují zejména staging, grading a reziduální velikost tumoru po cytoreduktivním zákroku (OC), resp. Gleason score a přítomnost metastatických ložisek (PCa) ze sérových tumorových markerů potom zejména CA 125 (mucin 16) u ovariálního karcinomu a PSA (prostate serum antigen) u karcinomu prostaty. Přestože bylo do současné doby charakterizováno velké množství dalších kandidátních biomarkerů, zůstávají stále CA 125, resp. PSA základními diagnostickými a prediktivními faktory. Nicméně jejich zásadním nedostatkem je nízká diagnostická senzitivita, diskutabilní využití při detekci raných stádií a nízká schopnost dlouhodobé predikce. Problematika nových molekulárních markerů pro diagnostiku, monitoring a predikci rozvoje prostatických a ovariálních karcinomů je tak vysoce aktuální. Předchozí práce navrhovatelů ukázaly na potenciálně významné geny, jejichž exprese je deregulována v nádorových buňkách a které mají schopnost predikovat vývoj onemocnění.

Jedním z největších problémů, kterým čelí použití hESC v klinické praxi je jejich adaptace na in vitro kultivační podmínky spojená s destabilizací genomu a případným onkogenním potenciálem transplantovaných buněk. Tento potenciál se však může projevit až přenosem hESC a od nich buněk odvozených do lidského in vivo prostředí aniž by se projevil v současných testech. Je také pravděpodobné, že adaptace by mohla být i za současnými neúspěchy klinických pokusů aplikace hESC, při kterých buňky aplikované pacientům ztratily svůj diferenciační potenciál, což ovšem opět není možné detekovat dostupnými technikami. Z hlediska onkogenního potenciálu je nejdůležitější schopnost hESC po transplantaci vytvořit buňky podobné těm z embryonálního karcinomu (EC-like).

Pacienti s metabolickým syndromem mají dlouhodobě zvýšené riziko kardiovaskulárních onemocnění a kardiovaskulární a celkové mortality. Další vysoce rizikovou skupinou jsou pacienti již v sekundární prevenci, např. po infarktu myokardu. Regulace patofyziologických dějů po infarktu myokardu probíhá na více úrovních. Jako nové biomarkery, ale i možné slibné terapeutické cíle se jeví malé molekuly RNA, jejich hladiny detekujeme v cirkulaci  - tzv. mikroRNA (miRNA). MiRNA jsou regulační stabilní nekódující molekuly RNA, které obsahují přibližně 20-26 nukleotidů a regulují genovou expresi vazbou na mediátorovou RNA. Vazbou na mediátorovou RNA (mRNA) inhibují přepis do proteinu (inhibice translace). Dosud bylo identifikováno více než 600 humánních miRNA. V předchozích pracích byla prokázána souvislost některých miRNA s obezitou, diabetem nebo reperfůzním poškození srdce.;CZ;;Academic

Nedávno bylo zjištěno, že do mléka se uvolňuje řada tzv. adipokinů, látek vytvářených v tukové tkáni i mléčné žláze matky, které mají zároveň výrazné imunomodulační účinky u novorozence. K dispozici je ovšem pouze velmi málo informací o tom, jakým způsobem jsou adipokiny v mateřském mléce regulovány a jakým způsobem je řízena odpověď kojence na adipokiny v mateřském mléce, přičemž se dá očekávat, že se bude jednat o mechanismy epigenetické. Možné pojítko představují miRNA, které jsou do mateřského mléka uvolňovány a které mají potenciálně mohutné účinky na imunitní systém dítěte. V současnosti není k dispozici žádná studie, která by se zabývala dynamikou hladin miRNA v mateřském mléce vzhledem k hladinám specifických adipokinů, které jsou do mléka secernovány.
Cílem navrhovaného projektu je identifikace miRNA exprimovaných do mateřského mléka,  sledování dynamiky exprese miRNA v mateřském mléce/séru matky v časovém horizontu 1 roku po porodu, stanovení souvislostí s hladinami specifických adipokinů uvolňovaných do mateřského mléka a hledání možných predikčních markerů ze skupiny miRNA, které by bylo možné použít pro odhad vyššího/nižšího hmotnostního přírůstku novorozence-kojence v daném časovém období laktace.

Na úrovni všech organismů jsou tyto tlaky kompenzovány celou sítí procesů odpovědí na poškození DNA (DDR), které zprostředkovávají kontrolu genomu a jeho opravu. Biologický význam těchto procesů je zřejmý z toho, že defekty v síti DDR způsobují predispozici k různým závažným onemocněním a jejich následný vývoj. Navržený projekt zahrnuje 5 týmů se synergickými modely a expertízami, které se budou zabývat identifikací nových komponent a regulací odpovědí na DDR a přispějí tak k objasnění základních mechanismů a koordinace replikace, rekombinace a opravy DNA. Projekt také poskytne nízkomolekulární modulátory klíčových enzymů DDR a umožní tak vytvoření a validaci nástrojů k lepšímu porozumění mechanismů a aberací procesů, které představují ochranu proti faktorům ohrožujícím integritu genomu.

Praktická výuka dětské otorinolaryngologie má své značné specifika a obtíže. Ty spočívají jednak v nutnosti návazat kontakt a důvěru s dětským pacientem a jednak samotné vyšetřování, diagnostika a terapeutické zákroky probíhají v málo přehledných a obtížně dostupných lokalitách, což je dáno složitostí anatomie hlavy a krku. Praktická znalost prostorových a funkčních vztahů v oblasti ORL je nezbytná pro pochopení fyziologických a následně i patologických procesů zde probíhajících, tak aby student LF po absolvování předmětu ORL byl schopen tyto procesy vysvětlit a v praxi rozpoznat, obzvlástě proto, že problematika děstké ORL představuje značnou část onemocnění v dětském věku obecně. Počet studentů LF neustále narůstá a z výše uvedených skutečností vyplývá fakt, že se snižuje dostupnost praktické výuky pro konkrétního studenta v našem specifickém oboru. Proto jsme se rozhodli požádat o finanční prostředky z programu FRVŠ ve výši 1, 726.000,- Kč, které chceme využít na zakoupení zařízení potřebných k zajištění dostupnosti a zkvalitnění praktické výuky dětské ORL. Konkrétně se jedná o zakoupení speciální kamery, prezentačního 3DTV, které umožní nahrávaní a pořízení 3D snímků a filmů, což je v ORL oblasti unikátní možnost jak demonstrovat v praxi anatomické a funkční vztahy i patologické procesy.

Procento obyvatel nad 65 let věku se zvýšilo za tejné období z 12,5%  na 15,2%. Adekvátně tomuto vývoji se zvyšuje procento geriatrických nemocných ve většině ambulancí i lůžkových zařízení.
     Vzhledem k tomu, že se zvyšujícím se věkem jsou starší nemocní léčeni pro vyšší počet chorob, užívají vyšší počty medikamentů s možností vzájemných lékových interakcí, jejich choroby mají svá specifika jako oligosymptomatologii, mikrosymptomatologii, přenos na jiné orgány apod., vyžaduje diagnostika i terapie starších nemocných specifický přístup charakterizovaný především nutností celostního pohledu na konkrétního nemocného.
     Projekt předpokládá vytvoření sylabu přednášek předmětu Geriatrie zdůrazňujících základní odlišnosti přístupu ke geriatrickému nemocnému za různých klinických situací včetně podkladů pro posluchače, sylabu praktických cvičení s demonstrací a vlastním prožitkem smyslového, kognitivního a motorického deficitu a vytvoření výukového filmu, který bude umístěn na portálu LF MU.
     Tento projekt má za cíl nahlédnout více do problematiky celostní péče o typického geriatrického pacienta, což znamená nejen řešení konkrétní akutně probíhající choroby u nemocného, ale holistický pohled na křehkého pacienta.  Komunikace s geriatrickými pacienty nebývá vždy jednoduchá ať již z pohledu jejich kognitivního či smyslového deficitu, ale také z důvodu toho, že do péče o pacienty samotné musíme zahrnout jejich rodinné příslušníky a komunikovat s nimi. 
     Ze zkušenosti mladých lékařů v atestační přípravě vyplývá, že v době studií i po jejich ukončení si nedokážou zdaleka představit náročnost a komplexnost péče o pacienta staršího věku, kterých v dnešní době stále na odděleních akutní medicíny přibývá, tvoří 30-50% pacientů lůžek akutní péče (zastoupení se různí v chirurgických a interních oborech).";CZ;;Academic

Ve vývoji hypertenze hraje vedle renin-angiotenzinového systému úlohu také snížená citlivost baroreflexní regulace. Protože epiteliální sodíkový kanál (ENaC) hraje zásadní roli v detekci změn krevního tlaku u člověka, předpokládáme, že  některé z jeho mutací by mohly mít vliv na hodnotu citlivosti baroreflexu (BRS).

V HRD dráze předpokládáme roli centrozomových abnormalit v B buňkách. Obě dráhy následně vedou k dysfunkcím D cyklinů. Hlavním cílem tohoto projektu je objasnit roli dysregulace cyklinů D, Ig translokací, hyperdiploidie a centrozomových abnormalit v těchto dvou drahách patogeneze MM. Předpokládáme klíčovou roli genomické instability v B buňkách jako platformu pro časné onkogenní jevy v myelomových buňkách.Hlavním cílem tohoto projektu je odhalit vztah mezi primárními translokacemi, dysregulací D cyklinů, centrozomovými abnormalitami a hyperdiploidií v B buňkách i plazmatických buňkách.

I když došlo v posledních letech k velkým pokrokům v léčbě MM, je stále nevyléčitelnou chorobou a všichni pacienti relabují. Neexistují žádně vhodné prognostické markery, které by byly snadno dostupné a které by bylo možno odebírat bez většího nepohodlí pro pacienty. miRNA jsou krátké nekódující RNA, které ovlivňují expresi genů a nedávno byly spojeny s iniciací, prognózou a rozvojem nemocí. miRNA jsou velmi stabilní i v séru a my předpokládáme, že mohou být použity jako prognostické markery pro pacienty s vysokým rizikem relapsu MM. Chceme najít kandidátní panel sérových miRNA pomocí arraye na bázi real-time PCR. Role těchto miRNA bude objasněna v in vitro pokusech, abychom pochopili jejich roli v patogenezi MM a jejich možný účinek na buněčnou proliferaci, apoptózu a buněčný cyklus.;CZ;;Academic

Na základě našich předchozích studií (Krejčířová et al. 2010), kdy jsme prokázali, že těžké kovy přestupují přes placentu březí myši do jejich fétů a působí v orgánech výrazné změny různé intenzity od morfologických odchylek až po nekrózy, jsme se rozhodli najít způsob ochrany fétů před toxickými účinky těžkých kovů přijatými samicemi v potravě v době březosti.
Domníváme se, že dnes, kdy se opět stává aktuálním tématem znečištění životního prostředí a je řadou studií prokázána přítomnost těžkých kovů v potravě (např. mořští živočichové, luštěniny apod.) se ochrana zdraví jedince již v průběhu jeho vývoje in utero jeví z hlediska prevence velmi žádoucí.
Na základě zatím ojedinělých studií některých autorů (Ahokas at al. 1980, Roelfzema at al. 1988), kteří popsali po podání zinku snížený prostup těžkých kovů placentou předpokládáme, že budeme-li současně s těžkými kovy podávat zvířatům i zinek, tento zabrání vstupu těžkých kovů do orgánů fétů. Tento blokační účinek zinku prokážeme tím, že morfologické odchylky či nekrózy ve vybraných orgánech myších fétů nenalezneme či jen v ojedinělých případech.
Na závěr je třeba ještě zdůraznit, že pokus na myších byl koncipován záměrně z důvodu shody morfologických znaků myší placenty s placentou lidskou a to proto, aby bylo možno z našich výsledků dovodit závěry pro humánní medicínu.";CZ;;

Zvláštní důraz pak bude kladen na možnost aktivace p53 v nádorech, v nichž je funkce p53 vyřazena nadměrnou expresí endogenních inhibičních proteinů Mdm2, MdmX nebo virového proteinu E6, jako jsou např. některé sarkomy a karcinomy prsu nebo děložního čípku. Budou proto hledány a testovány i kombinace inhibitorů funkce těchto proteinů s chemickými látkami, které jsou schopny účinně aktivovat p53. Dále budou hledány nové buněčné regulátory p53, které by mohly sloužit jako cíle pro molekulárně cílenou terapii některých typů nádorů.

Kromě postižení tenkých senzitivních vláken (neuropatie tenkých vláken – NTV) hrají pravděpodobně roli další faktory. Existují experimentální a předběžné klinické důkazy, že roli mohou hrát zejména prozánětlivé cytokiny a neurotrofiny. Cílem projektu je ověřit význam postižení tenkých somatických vláken pro rozvoj diabetické periferní neuropatické bolesti, zejména přítomnost specifického vzorce postižení jednotlivých typů nervových vláken charakteristického pro rozvoj neuropatické bolesti v jednotlivých stádiích rozvoje diabetické neuropatie. Dále zhodnotit lokální i systémový vliv některých potenciálních patogenetických faktorů (cytokiny, neurotrofiny) a nových markerů regenerace nervových vláken v kožní biopsii na rozvoj bolesti u diabetické neuropatie.

V předloženém projektu jde o vývoj moderních elektronických prostředí a prostředků podporujících sdílení prostředků výuky. Hlavním cílem pražských lékařských fakult je zavedením a zdokonalování zcela nové formy a úrovně spolupráce –WikiSkript. Jejich principem je velká otevřenost, která usnadňuje autorům tvorbu a podporuje aktualizace. Stimuluje k další tvorbě obsahu i zdokonalování prostředí, a především vtahuje studenty aktivně do vzdělávacího procesu. Vzdělávací proces se tímto systémem výrazně zefektivňuje a současně se zvyšuje evropská konkurenceschopnost zapojených lékařských fakult. 
V roce 2011 je třeba WikiSkripta rozšířit jako inovativní systém pro elektronickou podporu výuky. Jsou prostorem pro tvorbu a sdílení výukových materiálů. Jejich ostrý provoz byl zahájen na 1. lékařské fakultě UK v roce 2009. I přes krátkou dobu své existence zaznamenávají natolik prudký růst využívání, že nyní vyžadují podstatné posílení technického zázemí a studentské redakční podpory, která autorům technicky a administrativně pomáhá s tvorbou obsahu. Současně roste zájem o Wikiskripta na dalších lékařských fakultách a proto je třeba postupně vyškolit redakční týmy na všech lékařských fakultách, aby byly schopny podporovat lokální autory. K naplnění tohoto cíle bude třeba získat nové členy studentských redakčních týmů a uspořádat pro ně řadu školení a seminářů.

V poslední době se ukazuje, že hrají zásadní roli v regulaci imunitních funkcí a můžou tak zabránit autoimunitním a nádorovým onemocněním. T regulační lymfocyty jsou složkou imunitního systému, potlačují imunitní odpověď a představují atraktivní buněčnou populaci v souvislosti s imunoterapií nádorů, imunitních a infekčních onemocnění a na poli posttransplantační imunomodulace. V naší pilotní studii jsme nalezli 9 rozdílně exprimovaných miRNA (20b, 31, 99a, 100, 125b, 151, 335, 365 and 146a) u lidských T regulačních lymfocytů v porovnání s konvenčními T lymfocyty. Prioritou tohoto projektu je potvrdit tyto výsledky a následně nejen testovat vliv vybraných miRNA na regulační funkci T lymfocytů, ale také identifikovat cílové geny miRNA, jenž mají vliv na regulaci imunitní odpovědi. Ideou je objasnit funkční mechanismus konkrétních miRNA na regulaci T lymfocytů, tak že by případná imunoterapie mohla zahrnout podání specifické miRNA (anti-miRNA) a ovlivňovat tak její cílové geny.;CZ;;

Vaskulární endotelium výraznou měrou podporuje přežívání maligních plazmatických buněk a ty recipročně stimulují novotvorbu cév. Na indukci angiogeneze/vaskulogeneze se podílejí angiogenní aktivátory, které stimulují endotelové buňky (EC) nebo rekrutují cirkulující endotelové prekurzory (CEC). Za zdroj CEC jsou považovány CD14+monocyty (CD14+ MO) exprimující angiogenní marker Tie-2. CD14+ MO hrají potenciální roli v novotvorbě cév a tumorigenezi. Mechanismy zodpovědné za transdiferenciaci CD14+ MO do CEC jsou však zatím nejasné. V současnosti je za nejvýznamnější angiogenní marker u MM při použití konvenční terapie považován hepatocytární růstový faktor (HGF).

V navrhovaném projektu - nekomerční randomizované klinické studii fáze II - bychom chtěli testovat účinek nové vakcíny založené na autologních dendritických buňkách produkujících interleukin-12. Univerzitní centrum buněčné imunoterapie Masarykovy univerzity v Brně má povolení Státního ústavu pro kontrolu léčiv k výrobě dendritických buněk pro klinické použití. Vakcína bude pacientům podávána podle randomizačního modelu 1:1, tj. polovina pacientů bude léčena standardní léčbou (nefrektomie následovaná sunitinibem) a druhá polovina standardní léčbou kombinovanou s vakcinací. Budeme monitorovat bezpečnost, účinnost, klinický a imunologický vliv tohoto experimentálního přístupu, který by mohl vést k nové léčebné strategii nejen pacientů s metastázujícím renálním karcinomem, ale otevřít možnost této kombinované léčby i pro pacienty s dalšími typy nádorových onemocnění.;CZ;;

Naší hypotézou je, že pacienti s extramedulárním relapsem mají v organismu přítomen odlišný klon nádorových buněk, který je schopen tvořit ložiska mimo skelet. Předpokládáme existenci dvou typů plasmocytů a to v dřeňovém a měkkotkáňovém kompartmentu.

V průběhu posledních 20 let stoupla incidence KR-CA téměř o 200 %. Vzhledem k tomu, že většina karcinomů vzniká z adenomu velmi pomalu, je optimálním cílem screeningového programu,  který je v ČR již několik let realizován. Spolupráce populace je však doposud poměrně malá. Příbuzní prvního stupně nemocných s KR-CA, tj.  rodiče, sourozenci a děti, mají ve srovnání s ostatní populací 4x vyšší pravděpodobnost vzniku KR-CA. I přes  tento fakt  jsou však preventivní vyšetření v těchto  rodinách zcela nedostatečná. 
Cíle našeho programu, který má podporu primátora města Brna Romana Onderky,  jsou dvojí: 
-podstatně zvýšit počet vyšetřených v rodinách s výskytem KR-CA.  Příbuzní nemocných budou námi aktivně kontaktováni, budou informováni o přínosu preventivního vyšetření a bude jim nabídnuta možnost koloskopického vyšetření na naší klinice event. minimálně vyšetření imunochemickým testem okultního krvácení do stolice (kvantitativní test s vyšší senzitivitou v porovnání s běžně užívaným guajakovým testem). U osob s Lynchovým syndromem bude prováděno genetické vyšetření. Databáze nemocných bude vedena na IBA MU, což umožní porovnání efektivity tohoto programu s celostátním screeningovým programem.    
-Spoluprací s praktickými lékaři, ambulantními gastroenterology a za použití mediálních prostředků propagace a individuálních dopisů zvýšit spolupráci cílové populace. 
Finanční prostředky jsou potřebné na:  
-nákup endoskopu umožňujícího senzitivnější vyšetření sliznice tlustého střeva (zoom, chromoendoskopie)
-náklady spojené s imunochemickým testem okultního krvácení
-platbu pro pracovníka s úvazkem 0,1 pověřeného kontakty s rodinou

Rovněž bude provedena analýza microRNA MSC ve vztahu k autoimunitním onemocněním a k hematopoeze. Konečným cílem projektu je pak návrh klinického léčebného protokolu. Řešení projektu bude probíhat v Univerzitním centru buněčné imunoterapie Masarykovy univerzity, které jako jediné v ČR je držitelem povolení SÚKL k přípravě individualizovaných protinádorových vakcín na akademické půdě.;CZ;;

v nádorových buňkách často inhibována nadměrnou produkcí onkoproteinů Mdm2 a MdmX. Mdm2 funguje
jako ubikvitin ligáza pro p53 a indukuje degradaci p53 v proteasomu 26S. Příbuzný protein MdmX, jenž nemá
ubikvitin ligázovou aktivitu a nedokáže indukovat degradaci p53, účinně inhibuje transkripční aktivitu proteinu
p53. V předchozí studii se nám však podařilo prokázat, že i MdmX se může aktivně podílet na degradaci p53
jako součást komplexu s Mdm2, jeho přesná úloha při ubikvitylaci p53 však stále zůstává nejasná. Proto
hodláme pomocí cílené mutageneze provést srovnání a funkční analýzu RING domén Mdm2 a MdmX, které
umožňují vzájemnou vazbu těchto proteinů a jsou též nezbytné pro ubikvitin ligázovou aktivitu jejich

Ph.D.;15548;not approved. invest.;01.01.2010;31.12.2013;Recipient;GA ČR / Standard projects;LF;Institute of Anatomy;Poškození nervu způsobuje buněčné a molekulární změny, které se podílí součastně na regeneraci a indukci neuropatické bolesti. Cytokiny a jejich receptory se účastní obou těchto procesů. Navíc můžou fungovat jako signální molekuly v přenosu do dalších částí nervového systému, které nejsou asociovány s nervovým poškozením. Nicméně signální dráhy cytokinů v nervovém systému nejsou zatím detailně charakterizovány. Cílem tohoto projektu je studium cytokinů, jako TNF-alpha a IL-6 a jejich receptorů (TNFR1, TNFR2, IL6R a GP130) u struktur nervového systému krysy asociovaných a neasociovaných s poškozením nervu, v cerebrospinální tekutině a krvi. Buněčná distribuce a kvantitativní změny hladin cytokinů a jejich receptorů budou studovány pomocí metod imunohistochemie, ELISA, Western blotu a in situ hybridizací. Předpokládáme, že výsledky získané těmito experimenty, přispějí k našim znalostem signálních drah cytokinů při reinervaci a neuropatické bolesti.;CZ;;Employee

Přibližně u jedné třetiny pacientů je farmakologická léčba neśpěšná a záchvaty přetrvávají. V těchto případech se někdy přistupuje k operační léčbě. Jejím ideálním cílem je odstranění epileptického ložiska a úplné vyléčení nemocného jedince. V rámci přípravy epileptochirurgického řešení je zcela zásadní přesná identifikace epileptického ložiska, či přesněji epileptogenní zóny. V současnosti však neexistuje metoda, která by samostatně dokázala tento cíl splnit . Velmi nadějným se v dané souvislosti zdálo být simultánní snímání EEG a funkční MRI (EEG-fMRI). Jedná se o multimodální zobrazovací techniku, kde jsou EEG a fMRI data snímána současně. Tato metoda v zásadě umožňuje zobrazit na MR snímcích mozku oblasti s hemodynamickými změnami přímo souvisejícími s interiktálními epileptickými výboji. V případě jednoduché analýzy MR signálu časově spřaženého s výskytem interiktálního epileptického výboje v EEG záznamu, však tato poskytuje spolehlivé výsledky pouze cca u třetiny pacientů s ložiskovou epilepsií. Nové postupy zpracování MR signálu (zejména analýza nezávislých komponent /ICA/ a jiné vícerozměrné metody) mohou velmi pravděpodobně významně zlepšit vypovídací schopnost EEG-fMRI a zvýšit validitu výsledků u kandidátů epileptochirurgického zákroku.

preimplantačních blastocyst, které mají schopnost udržet si svůj nediferencovaný potenciál a proliferují bez zřejmého limitu. Schopnost proliferace bez limitu a udržení pluripotentního stavu jsou úzce spjaty s regulací buněčného cyklu. Nedávné publikace ukazují na fakt, že řízení buněčného cyklu v hES buňkách je odlišné od regulace buněčného cyklu v somatických buňkách. Regulace buněčného cyklu u hES buněk je dosud velmi málo prostudována a není známo, jak buněčný cyklus ovlivňuje vlastnosti hES buněk.

V somatických buňkách je buněčný cyklus řízen postupnou aktivací cyklin dependentních kináz (CDK) v závislosti na průchodu jednotlivými fázemi buněčného cyklu. Tři kinázy z rodiny CDK (CDK2, CDK4 a CDK6) regulují průchod interfází, CDK1 reguluje průchod G2 fází a mitózou. 

Naše preliminární data ukazují, že molekulární mechanismy, které jsou odpovědné za řízení buněčného cyklu v hES buňkách, se liší od mechanismů v somatických buňkách. Při poškození DNA se hES buňky akumulují v G1/S fázi buněčného cyklu, avšak nedochází k poklesu aktivity CDK2, která normálně řídí přechod mezi G1 a S fází. Dochází ale k poklesu aktivity CDK1, která v somatických buňkách řídí přechod z G2 fáze do mitózy. Uvedené skutečnosti naznačují, že CDK1 může hrát roli v řízení interfáze buněčného cyklu v hES buňkách.
