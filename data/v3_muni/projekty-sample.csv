 The project chooses several major medical topics - diseases for which breakthrough scientific knowledge can be expected to be obtained by using current technologies combining the most advanced 3D models (organoids, engineered tissues), genetic analyses, bioactive molecules and ex vivo functional analyses, which are the unifying element of the project.
 The project builds on close collaboration between clinical and theoretical disciplines, paving the way for new preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, and thus has strong application potential.
 The project makes significant use of multidisciplinary approaches, and its design maximises the sharing of knowledge and infrastructure.
 Organisationally, the project is conceived as a close cooperation between theoretical departments of the Faculty of Medicine and the clinical departments of the partner hospitals. It is then joined by interactions with other MU faculties, the Faculty of Pharmacy, the Faculty of Science, CEITEC and the Faculty of Social Studies, as well as with institutions outside MU, the Brno University of Technology (CEITEC), the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the CAS, the Institute of Physiology of the CAS and the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry of the CAS.";EN;;academic, employee

By creating artificial electronic connections to nervous tissue, neural activity can be sensed and also externally modified by electrical stimulation. Smart biomedical devices, built on the interconnection of electronics with living systems, represent one of the fastest growing and promising new directions in medicine today. Such devices can be used to diagnose and treat neurological diseases and injuries. This dynamic field is known as bioelectronic medicine. In parallel, the last decades have been characterized by major advances in nano- and micro-technologies for electronics and optoelectronics. Unfortunately, it is currently difficult to translate state-of-the-art electronic solutions into practice, especially in the European medical community. This gap is largely the result of limited communication and collaboration between electronic technology experts, biomedical engineers and physicians. NeuroBMI's goal is to bridge this gap and create a solid base for manufacturing and testing bioelectronic devices in the Czech Republic. Much of the necessary infrastructure and expertise is already in place, but interdisciplinary links need to be established and deepened with clear intentions. FP1 is dedicated to the development of new neural interface devices for the consortium as a whole and for the wider neuroscience community. FP1 contains four research objectives, A-D: A: Implantable brain probes to advance neuroscience research in animals; B: Implantable neural interfaces for peripheral nerves in animal models; C: New integrated magnetoelectronic devices for wireless power transfer; D: Accelerated component lifetime testing and systematic investigation of functional failures.";EN;;academic, employee

It aims at identifying the origin of epileptic seizures within the brain to target surgery and cure the epilepsy. Due to its unmatched temporal resolution (in the order of the millisecond) and spatial precision (millimetric), iEEG offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms leading to the emergence of seizure, develop novel biomarkers to improve the outcome of epilepsy surgery (e.g. high-frequency oscillations (HFOs)) but also investigate brain physiology. Indeed, many of the 150 to 250 recording leads available in each investigated patients are located in normal brain tissue, and thus enable to study normal brain function, including cognition. The main limitation of this research field is the limited number of patients undergoing such investigation, about 500 per year in Europe. This makes iEEG data particularly well suited to data sharing, data re-use and data FAIRification. With this view in mind, the European Flagship Human Brain Project has developed a platform dedicated to this objective, the Human Intracerebral EEG platform (HIP). This cloud-based, GDPR-compliant open-source platform precisely aims at sharing and re-using iEEG data, software and research projects at an international scale. Two of the partners (CHUV and HCL) were involved in this development, with CHUV being its product owner.

The goal of this project is to build a strong and internationally recognized center of chemical biology research that will pursue interdisciplinary studies utilizing synergistic interactions of several disciplines, especially biology and chemistry, and will explore practical applications of the research outcomes. 
Understanding the chemico-biological interactions at different levels is essential for both intervention and treatment (e.g. development of new small molecules as pharmacologically active substances/drugs to treat disease conditions) as well as for prevention of adverse outcomes and understanding of the effects of pollutants in the environment. Typically, these two aspects are currently studied separately. This project will improve sharing of personnel, research infrastructures and capacities in these two areas and will thereby bring major added value for chemical biology science and fulfil the planned objectives. 
The main strategic goal of this project is to build a top-quality research hub in the field of chemical biology that will generate globally competitive know-how with attractive commercial potential and significant societal impact. The project will exploit the long-term investment of MUNI into this research area – specifically building of University Campus Bohunice (UKB), followed by setting up the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) and European Centre of excellence in Environmental Health sciences (RECETOX), implementation of numerous large research infrastructures into UKB environment, and more recently by the planned launch of the BioPharmaHub and integration of the Faculty of Pharmacy to MUNI.
This goal will be achieved by intensifying of multidisciplinary interaction among the relevant workplaces (mostly located within one campus), using the potential of the most competitive research teams at MUNI.

The task of physicians is to recognise the typical patterns of diagnoses in this jumble of information (""pattern recognition/inductive reasoning"") or, if no pattern is recognised, to deduce other possible diagnoses from them (""deductive reasoning""). The establishment of a correct diagnosis is an essential step in the initiation of correct and effective treatment, and therefore the process of differential diagnosis and its perfect mastery is a fundamental skill for every physician. In case of uncertainty, or in the presence of general symptoms occurring in several different diseases, various (bio)markers can help in the differential diagnostic analysis, which should reduce the risk of a possible diagnostic error. Similarly, answering the frequent question of our patients ""What's next for me?"", i.e. to provide the patient with information about the future course of his/her disease, is often difficult, and it is the identification of new (bio)markers that may enable this prognostic stratification.

Early detection of abnormalities in cerebral cortex morphology are a promising approach leading to better diagnostics and treatment. 
We propose an interdisciplinary cooperation between researchers in MR imaging, signal processing and analysis, data science and modelling, machine learning, and neurobiology of mental disorders to deliver a method for imaging and measuring of brain cortical subcomponents. This novel neuroimaging method will be based on tailored T1 relaxometry, component modelling, classification with machine learning algorithms, and signal transformations. The ability of the proposed method to capture the targeted fine gray matter structures will be evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art results as well.  
Using this multidisciplinary approach, we aim at increasing the spatial resolution of brain structural magnetic resonance imaging which at its current state does not enable to directly detect and evaluate relevant neuropathological features. Our proposed neuroimaging method will enable visualization and measurement of the cortical subcomponents that correspond to individual cortical layers.

The result is thereafter a maintaining of good quality of patient’s life, which has direct economic consequences for patient’s family and for public finances, because health and social care costs do not increase. In the past years the works have been published, in which artificial intelligence had been used to analyse finding on MRI of brain. Our goal is to examine, whether the artificial intelligence can be used in direct diagnosis.

The source is usually the patient, rarely a reservoir in the environment. Its production occurs mainly during certain therapeutic or diagnostic procedures. Bioaerosol may be involved in the transmission of agents such as SARS-CoV-2 or MDR bacterial strains. Risk minimisation can be achieved through organisational, barrier and technical measures. However, assessing and comparing the effectiveness of these practices in practice is very difficult and often their implementation is based on purely empirical experience.

Also, cells undergoing the process of cell death release EVs into their surroundings, which not only affect surrounding and relatively distant cells with different effects but also carry specific information about the type of cell death that is taking place in the dying cells.

Nowadays, cytostatic drugs are commonly used in the treatment of cancer, which unfortunately only affect the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant cells. New anti-cancer therapeutic approaches aimed specifically against invasiveness and metastasis are still lacking. Migrastatic strategies represent a unique therapeutic approach preventing the development of systemic malignant disease and limiting cancer-related death. As the migration machinery has been shown to promote metastatic dissemination, a successful migrastatic therapy may reduce the need for high-dose cytotoxic therapies currently used to prevent the risk of metastatic dissemination, which can be beneficial to a patient's well-being. The best targets for migrastatic therapy would be those that are required by all forms of motility, such as ATP availability, mitochondrial metabolism, and cytoskeleton rearrangement.Pentamethinium salts (PMS) are a group of compounds characterized by fluorescence and variable cytotoxicity depending on the structure of the molecule and can play an important role in influencing the migration potential of tumor cells. PMS exhibit exceptional affinity and selectivity for cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane and have excellent photostability, fluorescence properties and low phototoxicity.

The assessment of the treatment response in the chick ChorioAllantoic Membrane (CAM) model can represent a useful screening tool for personalized medicine with the potential to improve patient management and treatment outcome. Destruction of the basement membrane can be easily visualized and tumour growth, invasion into the connective tissue, and metastasis can be accurately quantified in CAM assay, making CAM a valuable model for investigating cancer progression.

These prenatal exposures have long-lasting consequences for the child, manifesting as emotional and behavioral problems. Still, the mechanisms of this intergenerational transmission are not well understood. The ambition of MaHeChiDe is to identify the mechanisms underlying the relationships between maternal health during pregnancy and brain and behavior in the child. We aim to test the mediatory role of inflammation and accelerated aging in these relationships and demonstrate what environmental factors might magnify or protect against the negative impact of maternal illness during pregnancy. Preliminary work from my group demonstrated long-lasting impact of maternal depression during pregnancy on aging of the brain in young adulthood but the knowledge of the mechanisms has been limited by the lack of human longitudinal data with rich biosamples, neuroimaging, and decent sample size. Moreover, detailed assessments in early life, when the processes emerge, might be critical. We hypothesize that maternal mental health problems will be associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers and higher epigenetic age in the pregnant mother. We also hypothesize that higher levels of these markers will be in turn associated with lower epigenetic gestational age in the newborn and altered biological aging, neurodevelopment, and cognitive skills in childhood. If succeeded, this high risk – high gain project would provide ground-breaking new insights into the mechanisms of developmental programming and allow development of targeted interventions that would reduce the odds of mental illness in the new generations.;EN;;Employee

Episodic healthcare practices are ‘hospital-centric’ and are a norm since decades. Even though such system works successfully for routine ailments such as common cold, sore throat, and flu, but it is not suitable for chronic diseases and/or behavioral issues such as diabetes, depression, substance abuse, and cancer. Such conditions need multiple visits to doctors, constant treatments, and screening from time to time. All of this leads to a burden not only on patients and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system as a whole. All this points towards the need of continuous healthcare monitoring to either predict healthcare issues or diagnose them at very early stage, before they turn into chronic issues. Consequently, the world is moving towards ‘patient-centric’ continuum healthcare system focused on routine physical check-ups. Unfortunately, despite an alarming rise in the cases of mental issues, such systems are not yet well established for routine mental health check-ups.

Subpleural nodules in the lung parenchyma are usually not visible intraoperatively and their detection is possible only with the help of gentle palpation by the surgeon. However, this is often associated with the need to perform an open thoracotomy. Moreover, some small nodules, especially non-solid and sub-solid nodules, have similar rigidity to normal parenchyma and therefore are not palpable. Several techniques were developed, including patent blue V dye application under CT control. Patent blue V can rapidly diffuse into the marked tissues, which are then visually identified by the surgeon. Several studies using patent blue V to localize and facilitate nodule resection were performed. However, all were retrospective and to our best knowledge, no prospective study was done so far. We hypothesize that using patent blue V to guide lung node resection before VATS wedge resection is a safe technique to lower the rate of conversions to thoracotomy, postoperative complications, and mortality. Accordingly, this study will aim to compare intra and postoperative complications, hospital and ICU LOS, quality of life, and 30 days mortality in patients undergoing lung node resection using patent blue V and without.;EN;;academic, employee

In this project, we aim to address unresolved issues in the p53 field and transfer this knowledge to other diagnoses where TP53 defects also play a role. 1) To collect data on TP53 gene variants detected during diagnostics performed at the University Hospital Brno and in collaborating foreign laboratories and to identify variants with unclear clinical significance. 2) To clarify the biological basis and clinical impact of monoallelic TP53 defects by gene expression analysis. 3) To analyse the genetic background of TP53 defects in CLL and to describe whether they are mutually exclusive or associated with certain gene or genomic aberrations. The results of the project will be directly applicable in clinical practice as they will lead to improved diagnosis and prognosis of CLL patients. The findings will also contribute to a general deeper understanding of p53 function in tumours.;EN;;academic, employee

We show that DSBs are formed throughout the first half of prophase I and that unlike DSBs destined to be non-COs, DSBs distended to be COs are generated in a small time-window. This indicates that, contrary to the common view, meiotic DSBs are divided into specific populations that may be targeted differently to DSBR vs. SDSA. Moreover, we show that shifts in the mode of resection are correlated with the transition between these pathways. We propose to leverage the advantages of the genetically tractable model system, C. elegans, to elucidate the mechanisms involved in temporal regulation of DSB formation and processing in meiosis.;EN;;academic, employee

However, by using standard in vitro techniques of cell aggregation, discontinuous media exchange and slow diffusion of nutrients, the population of organoids is highly heterogeneous and their size is limited to small structures. Moreover, in the case of lung organoids, it is difficult to reproduce the cell spectrum and branching complexity of lung tissue without the presence of mesenchyme and capillaries. Thus, it is clear that morphogenesis of larger segments must be supported by the creation of an appropriate microenvironment, including flow, concentration gradient of signaling molecules, and the presence of endothelial and stromal cells.

However, the function of most of these cryptic splice sites, or even entire hidden exons, has not yet been revealed. Thus, these sites (exons) are probably not efficiently used for splicing but may still be recognized and/or subject to splicing that is not efficiently completed, thus contributing to an overall reduction in gene expression. We hypothesize that the specific interaction between these and the surrounding exons and spliceosome is not efficient enough and leads to non-catalytic inhibition of splicing at these sites. Investigation of the regulatory role of these elements is important to fully understand the process of pre-mRNA formation and subsequent expression of such encoded proteins.;EN;;Academic

Two types of C. sativa extracts, rich in CBD and in cannabigerol (CBG), are used as PCB sources in commercial preparations. We found a different effect of CBG and CBD on Nrf2 translocation in vitro and also on liver status after oral use. Home-made remedies can also contain psychotropic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Its effect on Nrf2 is unknown. As PCBs after oral use were found in skin, the project will study risk of long-term topical and oral application of C. sativa extracts, rich in CBD and in CBG and containing also THC with the focus on the Nrf2-driven pathway and barrier function of healthy skin.;EN;;Academic

SCZ requires lifelong treatment with antipsychotic drugs (APDs), but the most effective ones also cause adverse metabolic effects that contribute to cardiovascular risk and cause structural and functional changes in the brain. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been introduced as antidiabetic agents, are newly indicated in the treatment of obesity, and apparently suppress the adverse effects of APDs. Clinical trials are almost impossible to perform in these patients and GLP-1 RAs are therefore not recommended as standard therapy in this indication, mainly due to the lack of data confirming efficacy. In addition, GLP-1 RAs increase neurogenesis, modulate synaptic plasticity and have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. A thorough understanding of the potential of GLP-1 RAs to dually suppress brain changes and concomitant adverse metabolic effects of APDs is crucial for their clinical application, and our optimized preclinical model provides mechanistic insight into this issue.;EN;;Employee

Deviations in metabolism are therefore one of the key features of tumors and a potential therapeutic target. In prostate cancer, compared to most other tumors, oxidative phosphorylation is still the dominant source of ATP production. Maintaining functional mitochondria is therefore crucial. Prostate cancer cells are also specific in terms of biomechanics; an increase in cellular stiffness compared to non-tumor tissue is typical. Although the properties of the plasma membrane with its associated cytoskeleton and the nucleus are mainly involved in cellular stiffness, intracellular organelles may also contribute to the increase in cellular stiffness. Based on our data, a high degree of cross-linking of the mitochondrial network is evident. In light of the abundance of mitochondria and their high fusion and cytoskeletal cross-linking rates, it would be surprising if these organelles, or changes in their cytoskeletal cross-linking rates, were not involved in the increase in cell stiffness. Although this is advantageous in terms of ATP production, it may be a factor limiting migration and invasiveness for cancer cells. The project is based on the hypothesis that the interaction of the mitochondrial network with the cytoskeleton significantly affects cellular rigidity. The aim of the project is to explain the link between mitochondrial architecture, cellular stiffness, cancer cell aggressiveness and metabolism by targeted manipulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission";EN;;employee, academic

In this project, we propose a new view of stemness, based on a system of a constantly fluctuating population of cells with stem-like properties, to explain the constant readiness of tissues to variable environmental influences. The principle of unstable and less predictable stem cell behavior elucidates the efficient maintenance of tissue homeostasis and explains the inherent heterogeneity of stem cells and stemness itself. Using a unique model of the continuously growing mouse incisor combined with modern genetic, transcriptomic and imaging methods, we will test our hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, in vivo.

One of the key roles affecting the prognosis of patients is early and accurate diagnosis. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of gliomas, it is not uncommon to underestimate the specific disease and, as a consequence, to indicate inadequate therapy. However, despite all efforts, conventional diagnostic approaches still fail to detect microscopically more biologically aggressive foci that require a more intensive therapeutic approach. As even the actual treatment of gliomas has not advanced significantly over the last decade compared to other cancers, there is an increasing pressure from physicians to study new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets that would both refine glioma diagnosis and prolong patient survival. Non-coding RNAs, including both microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs, including circular RNAs (circRNAs), appear to be promising molecules in this regard. The key role of miRNAs in cancer pathology, including gliomas, has already been described in detail and generally accepted. In contrast, circRNAs represent a previously understudied group of long non-coding RNAs that arise from pre-mRNAs during reverse splicing, where the 3' end of a transcript is covalently linked to its 5' end to form a stable continuous loop. Their only confirmed function to date is miRNA ""sponging"", i.e. the ability to reversibly bind one or more miRNAs using specific binding sites, which subsequently prevents the miRNA from binding to its molecular targets and thus repressing translation. Moreover, recent data suggest that the levels of some circRNAs are significantly deregulated in gliomas. Therefore, the comprehensive study of circRNAs in gliomas represents a very promising approach to unveil new diagnostic biomarkers and, at the same time, therapeutic tools leading to more effective management of glioma patients.";EN;;Academic

We will focus in detail on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a model disease. CLL is usually characterized by monoclonal expansion of B lymphocytes. Antigenic stimuli are thought to play a key role in its development. However, in our previous work, we described cases of multi-clonal CLL, in which multiple B lymphocytes were clonally expanded in a single patient. These cases can be considered as an intermediate stage between the premalignant stage of monoclonal B lymphocytosis, which despite its name may be multi-clonal, and full-blown CLL. Based on a detailed analysis of the B cell receptor properties of the coexisting clones, we hypothesized that their final malignant transformation occurs at certain levels of B cell maturation. In the proposed project, we will use single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology and chromatin activity determination to identify the molecular profiles of the B cell matriculation stages at which malignant transformation occurs. Furthermore, the literature demonstrates that the initial changes occur at the stem cell level. We hypothesize that in this case, coexisting clones would share at least a few common mutations that would give the clones a selection advantage.

In this context innovation is seen as a means to transform the sector. However, healthcare innovations often fail or don't achieve wider uptake - even when benefits are documented. One of the main reasons is, that in healthcare technological innovation often also requires organisational innovation and the complex systems of multiple agents, their preferences, competences and conflicting interests slows adoption. Thus, the OPUS project reverses this logic by co-creating future care-settings for chronic patients from an organisational perspective as a basis for technological innovation processes. By focusing on life-style and self-management dimensions of chronic diabetes (Brno), coeliac disease (Maribor), hypertension (Rijeka) and frailty (Torino), we aim at transforming the way public healthcare services are provided through a patient-centred lens. These jointly envisioned future care-settings serve as a basis for Open Innovation strategies that through, an improved cross-sector cooperation, enhance the innovation capacities and the uptake of patient-centred approaches and technologies for better and more efficient services for chronic diseases. By deploying a Societal Robustness Methodology for jointly developing four care settings, co-creating four Open Innovation pilots, and anchoring the generalised, cross-regional learnings on the cross-sectoral interface between healthcare and innovation policy, OPUS contributes to improve the life of chronic patients, increases the efficiency of healthcare systems and enhances the cooperation among innovation stakeholders. In this process, cooperation is central for developing a robust understanding of future patient-centred care settings and for identifying challenges for their implementation that arise from different spatial, institutional and cultural contexts.;EN;;Academic

An iPSC-based model of neurodifferentiation will allow us to address the role of senescence in the development and aging of healthy human neurons, as well as to track this cellular response in the pathobiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). We believe that this study will not only introduce innovative approaches for AD/PD research, but will also help to unravel the role of senescence in the biology of healthy nervous systems and during neurodegeneration.;EN;;Academic

It is in line with the latest trends in contemporary oncology, i.e. personalized treatment or ""precision oncology"". Personalized treatment procedures are based on a detailed examination of the specific disease, its evolution over time (repeated biopsies - clonal evolution), biological analysis and the genetic background of the patient. For this purpose, both commercially available and ""in-house"" academic procedures based on molecular biology technologies are used. Data are subjected to bioinformatic analysis, which forms an integral part of these so-called theranostic approaches. Biological material is analysed by next-generation whole exome/genome sequencing (NGS), transcriptional profiling (RNAseq), detection of receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and detection of specific translocations/gene fusions. The panel of assays has been expanded to include methylome sequencing, liquid biopsies and, in 2020, MLPA and low-coverage whole-exome sequencing, among others. The information gathered is evaluated in regular expert meetings - the so-called expert panel (""molecular oncology tumor board""), based on which specific treatment recommendations are made in order to improve treatment outcomes for patients with high-risk cancer, such as children with refractory and relapsed solid tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). This can be achieved by personalized theranostic approaches, as demonstrated by our published results. Based on our experience, the personalized treatment principle can be applied to more than 60% of the patients examined. Our current procedures follow the latest trends in oncology (procedures such as ""liquid dynamic medicine"" and ""N-of-1 clinical trials"").";EN;;Academic

It is essential for neuroplasticity, cognitive development and consolidation of memory traces necessary in the learning process. It is suggested that SWA during deep sleep stages may be an electrophysiological marker of cortical maturation, which is atypical in children with PAS due to differences in thalamocortical circuits.;EN;;Academic

Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field in which this knowledge is used to combine stem/progenitor cells with bioactive materials and flow systems. However, the effective use of any stem cell type is completely dependent on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence stem cell behavior, our ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into functional somatic cell types, or our ability to generate and influence the three-dimensional arrangement of stem and progenitor cells. The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, (i) the molecular mechanisms responsible for genetic instability and genetic modifications of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, (ii) methods for isolation and characterization of the extracellular matrix and their impact on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, and (iii) microfluidic systems will be developed to coculture multiple types of stem and progenitor cells, (iv) the involvement of miRNA molecules in controlling differentiation and establishing stem cell plasticity will be investigated, (v) methods for forming 3D cell aggregates and differentiating them into specific tissue types will be developed, (vi) protocols for differentiating hES cells into relevant cell types, in particular epithelial, neural, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, will be further developed. The focus on human stem cells will be newly complemented by experiments aimed at understanding the origin and development of the human embryo, which is closely related to the issue of pluripotent cells and the medical applications based on them.

Imaging methods have undergone a significant evolution in the last decade, with the advent of methods such as PET/MR and dual-energy CT, which allow to reduce the radiation burden and improve the detection and characterization of tumor lesions. Not only diagnostic imaging methods have been improved, but also invasive endovascular or intratumoral treatment techniques. The integration of the findings of these new diagnostic methods into the patient's therapeutic plan enables the individualization of procedures in modern oncological treatment. Minimally invasive radiological-oncological interventions not only use imaging methods during the procedure, but as the first of the therapeutic modalities, they can use a spectrum of advanced imaging methods to monitor treatment response. The question is whether earlier and more accurate diagnosis and targeted minimally invasive treatment leads to improved overall survival of patients or whether overall survival is at the expense of systemic cancer treatment.;EN;;academic, student

For example, for some IPPs, we still do not know the exact pathophysiology of the disease or the effective causal treatment. As far as lung tumours are concerned, although we have various therapeutic options available, the prognosis of patients is nevertheless serious. Therefore, it is very important to study lung tissue and, in particular, to try to create three-dimensional models of healthy and pathological lung tissue in the laboratory, in health and in disease, to better understand the course of these lung diseases and, if necessary, to be able to test newly developed drugs on these models, thus enabling the personalisation of treatment in the future to the patient's exact requirements. In this project we will model lung tissue subject to interstitial lung processes (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis) and tumour transformation. In order to understand the pathogenesis and personalize the model, it is extremely important to obtain human cells, which are the only ones relevant for understanding disease pathogenesis and finding new therapeutic options. Such cells can be used directly in the form of isolation of primary cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells can be derived from them and differentiated into terminally differentiated lung tissue cell types. Subsequently, the cells can be combined with a cellular carrier, decellularized lung extracellular matrix, which recapitulates the basic architecture and bioactivity of lung tissue. This will allow us to create a 3D model of lung tissue under laboratory conditions and use it for research purposes. Studying human lung tissue samples and laboratory generated lung models will allow a more detailed understanding of the interrelationships and functional relationships between cells under conditions of health and disease, specifically the pathogenesis of IPP and lung cancer.

Distorted perceptions of one's own body and distorted perceptions of emotions are among the prominent symptoms across PPD diagnoses and contribute significantly to the onset and maintenance of these illnesses. However, most studies focus on patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and patients with bulimia nervosa (MB) tend to be neglected. Moreover, the neural mechanisms behind the significant distortions in body and emotion perception in PPP have not been elucidated, which as a result hinders the modernization of treatment approaches for these diseases. In the proposed project, we will compare 30 women with MA, 30 women with MB, and 30 healthy women, using clinical testing, self-report, and two MRI tasks to analyze the neural networks involved in the perception of self and others. The first task focuses on body perception, the second on emotion perception/awareness. The goal is to uncover key variables involved in perceptual biases, such as alexithymia or emotion regulation. Furthermore, we will carefully analyze functional and effective brain connectivity within the circuits responsible for dysfunctional perception in PPP. By combining phenomenological and objective (fMRI) data, we aim to identify specific biomarkers associated with a particular type of distortion. In doing so, we aim to offer clues to a more individualized approach in the treatment of PPP. Finally, based on the obtained brain stem model, we will propose specific targets for non-invasive neurostimulation aimed at normalizing neural circuits related to self-/other-perception in MA and MB.;EN;;Employee

It is a civilization and age specific condition that many of us have to deal with in old age. The current standard treatment for knee pain caused by severe damage to articular cartilage is total joint replacement. An alternative is autologous chondrocyte implantation, which treats cartilage defects and degeneration. After two decades of development, chondrocyte implantation seems to have reached its maximum for treatment with only mild healing effects and only in very young patients, but does not provide true cartilage regeneration in old age. Clearly, in vitro cultured chondrocytes did not offer a definitive solution for patients. Autologous implantation of chondrocytes is a treatment therapy offered by some orthopaedic clinics, but also rejected or even suspended (e.g. FN Brno, https://www.fnbrno.cz/kultivovane-chondrocyty/t2388). Therefore, as a new approach to the treatment of cartilage defects and degeneration, we would like to carry out research and development of chondrocyte stimulation directly in cartilage. Self-healing activated directly in cartilage, the newly developed in situ stimulation of chondrocytes should reverse their deprivation, rejuvenate and restore their original function and stimulate their clonal growth.;EN;;Academic

A growing group of genes is associated with retinal degeneration, but understanding of their role in retinal biology is very limited. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a systemic, rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy with a prevalence of approximately 1:150,000 in North America and Europe. BBS is therefore the most common non-lethal ciliopathy, involving early onset visual impairment. All efforts to treat inherited retinal degeneration diseases, including BBS, have so far resulted in only minimal success. The main objective of the present project is to characterize the molecular pathogenesis of retinal degeneration in BBS and to propose pharmacological modulation to prevent vision loss. Our hypothesis is that progressive vision loss in BBS is a consequence of prolonged intense ER stress, and that identification of signaling pathways activated in response to this stress and leading to cell death and their pharmacological modulation can prevent the onset and progression of the disease. Because mouse models do not fully match the phenotype of human BBS disease, primarily due to interspecies differences, in this study we will develop a high throughput system involving retinal organoids and pigmented retinal cells differentiated from human pluripotent cells derived from BBS patients. We will then use this tool to functionally diagnose selected specific mutations in BBS and to screen small molecules to reverse their pathological phenotype.;EN;;Academic

Survival time is significantly reduced by late detection of the disease, high metastatic potential of tumor cells and their resistance to cytostatic therapy, and there is considerable heterogeneity in response to treatment and survival among PDAC patients. This clinical heterogeneity is probably due to differences in the biological properties of PDAC cells. The global goals of this project are 1) to establish and expand a biobank of patient PDAC cell lines, and 2) to use these unique patient lines to determine whether expression of molecular regulators of PDAC cell response to mitochondrial stress and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, together with mass spectrometric, metabolic, clinical, and histopathological data, can identify patients with different survival times and responses to treatment. We will analyze this complex data using advanced biostatistical methods and artificial intelligence approaches that can help identify key biological parameters. The outcome of the project is therefore the PDAC Biobank as a necessary platform for personalized pancreatic cancer research, and the identification of complex biological determinants correlated with longer survival and response to treatment.

Most of these cancers are unresectable, and therefore other treatment modalities such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are being introduced. However, despite the undeniable benefit, clinical outcomes of TACE treatment can vary significantly between patients. Currently, imaging methods complemented by cytotoxicity assays are used to assess therapeutic response. However, this rather mechanistic approach does not take into account the molecular biological changes that occur in liver tissue by TACE (inflammation, hypoxia, increased temperature or tissue destruction accompanied by systemic secretion of cytokines and microRNAs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and are involved in oncogenesis and progression of liver cancer as well as in these biological processes, could represent ideal biomarkers.

Although these are relatively small numbers, these are individuals of working age whose prognosis is very poor and the pathogenesis of this disease is not satisfactorily understood. Often these are non-smokers or relatively short smokers, so a different causation of the cancer may be considered compared with older patients. Moreover, most patients in this age subgroup are diagnosed with aggressive forms of lung cancer. The genetic background of lung cancer occurring in patients younger than 40 years of age is poorly studied and only a higher incidence of EML4-ALK translocations in non-small cell lung cancer and EGFR gene mutations has been described in the literature. However, our preliminary analyses also revealed potentially targetable mutations in the genes for BRAF, PIK3CA or HER2 gene amplification. Therefore, advanced diagnosis of genetic aberrations in a subset of lung cancer patients under 40 years of age could help identify new potential targets for cancer therapy. The proposed project will be implemented as a multicentre patient recruitment trial, with the aim of a comprehensive analysis of molecular genetic alterations in early lung cancer. It will seek to identify a spectrum of possible genetic aberrations in tumor tissue beyond the commonly tested drivers (EGFR mutation and ALK translocation) using next generation sequencing (hotspot oncology panel, germline exome, somatic exome, fusion gene detection). The results obtained should not only increase the current level of scientific knowledge on the etiopathogenesis of lung cancer, but also significantly expand the therapeutic options within individualized treatment plans after the exhaustion of standard treatment options in young lung cancer patients.;EN;;Academic

In the Czech Republic, the situation is similar, with up to 1022 cases reported annually over the last decade. Syphilis is mostly diagnosed on the basis of a combination of clinical examination, anamnestic data and serological test results. Although serological tests are highly sensitive and specific, they have the disadvantage of false-negative results in the early stages of infection (when adaptive immunity is not sufficiently developed), as well as false-positivity of non-treponemal tests in other systemic diseases, or false-negativity of these tests in the case of the so-called 'prozone' effect. In previous studies, we have shown that direct diagnosis of syphilis by PCR detection of TPA DNA in skin and mucosal swabs (but not in whole blood samples) achieved a sensitivity of 76.4%, indicating that direct detection of TPA DNA has comparable sensitivity to indirect serological detection. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to develop a direct diagnostic method to detect TPA components directly in biological material (especially in whole blood samples, which are routinely collected for syphilis diagnosis). The main objectives of the project are the development of a direct diagnostic method for TPA based on the detection of DNA and RNA molecules, the development of new protocols for the detection of TPA (modules I-IV) and the development of a direct diagnostic method using samples with enriched treponemal DNA.

However, usually abrupt discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is successful in only about half of patients, and in the remaining patients, discontinuation may cause unpleasant withdrawal symptoms in up to 30% of cases. Sustained deep molecular response (DMR) as a prerequisite for attempted discontinuation is achieved in only 20-40% of all CML patients, so most of them are still referred to long-term, costly treatment, burdened with the risk of even very serious side effects. Also, no robust clinical or biological predictor of successful discontinuation has yet been identified. The present multicentre academic Phase II trial (HALF) represents an original concept of a two-phase stepwise dose reduction of a TKI (i.e. to half of the standard dose in the first half of the study, followed by administration of this already reduced dose on each day in the second half of the study) prior to their actual discontinuation, with the ambition to i) increase the proportion of patients achieving successful TFR, ii) reduce the incidence and/or severity of withdrawal syndrome symptoms, iii) identify clinical and biological factors associated with successful TFR, including correlation of previously unexplored aspects in relation to TFR (somatic mutations, pharmacokinetic analysis, etc.), iv) to conduct a unique, previously unperformed, discontinuation study on a national scale thanks to the participation of all centres of specialised haematological care in the country, and last but not least v) to confirm the efficacy and safety of a gradual and, in effect, significant dose reduction of TKIs as an acceptable and optimal alternative to complete discontinuation for most patients, which vi) will result in a reduction of economic costs both for the treatment itself and for the management of situations related to adverse effects of therapy.;EN;;Employee

The term neonatal sepsis is used to describe a systemic disease of bacterial, viral or fungal origin that is associated with significant haemodynamic changes and clinical manifestations resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Conventional laboratory tests such as haemoculture, leukocyte indices, acute phase reactants and heart rate have limits in diagnostic accuracy in neonatal sepsis, particularly low positive predictive value. These limits, combined with equivocal clinical signs that overlap with signs of immaturity, often force neonatologists to exclude sepsis from the differential diagnostic process. However, if antibiotic therapy is deployed only when the clinical manifestations are complete, the prognosis is unfavourable; on the other hand, liberal antibiotic policy leads to an increase in resistance of microorganisms.

Ph.D.;12972;not approved. invest.;01.01.2022;31.12.2026;Recipient;GA BLACK / JUNIOR STAR;LF;Research group of David Šmajs;Conventional methods for analyzing cell populations rely on fluorescent labeling of surface antigens by flow cytometry, such as CD34 expression in hematopoietic cells. However, the expression of these markers does not correlate with the success of therapy-transplantation. Assessment of the mechanical properties of cells has emerged as a means of obtaining information on the functional status of cells without the use of fluorescent labels. Cell stiffness is influenced by the cell cycle, differentiation, pathological processes such as malignant transformation or immune cell activation. Mechano-phenotyping is thus applicable to clinical areas - to identify hematopoietic stem cells or to analyze tumor cell progression. The currently used methods for the analysis of mechanical properties of cells are limited by low robustness or the need for highly expert operators (atomic force microscopy - AFM, etc.) and are not suitable for application in clinical diagnostics. The proposed approach extends the capabilities of quantitative phase microscopy by hardware modifications and computational methods for characterizing the shear stress response of cells, the so-called shear modulus. The method is feasible at sufficient robustness (hundreds-thousands of cells/hour), and does not require specialized consumables or highly specialized operators.;EN;;Academic

By 2050, the number of Alzheimer's dementia patients in the Czech Republic is expected to double to 300 000.  In the early stages, patients can remain in their own environment without major problems, but gradually the risk of failure in normal daily activities increases. Later on, a significant loss of independence develops, with the need for constant supervision and, of course, an increase in the complexity of the patient's care. This situation usually requires the elderly person to be placed in a social care facility such as a care home. However, the capacity of these facilities is limited and many caring families also want to continue to care for their elderly person, even though they have to manage their jobs at the same time. It is therefore important to be able to safely prolong the elderly person's ability to stay in their own environment. To prevent or solve these problems, various electronic aids with sensors and communication devices are being developed - flexible wearable devices for monitoring. Parameters monitored typically include basic vital signs, patient movement, fall signalling and interfacing with the caregiver and/or integrated rescue system. Progressive miniaturisation has made it possible to put the necessary technology into a wristwatch-sized device. This technology has already been tested at our institution as part of the NEUROSMART project, but most seniors with dementia encounter problems with the use of wristband technology. Seniors with dementia find it difficult to get used to new things in their environment and even more difficult on their bodies, i.e. they repeatedly remove and hide the bracelet, which causes false alarms and threatens the safety of the senior themselves. Furthermore, especially when paranoid, they consider the bracelet to be a tool of someone who is watching them, which causes them to become anxious or even delirious. The optimal solution seems to be to place the electronic technology on a part of the body where the senior cannot see or reach. The use of the back area in the shoulder blade region is suggested, with the development of a sufficiently miniature device and a sufficiently effective material to mount it for at least 48 hours. Thus, the project aims to optimize the adhesive material used and the miniaturization of the sensors, to improve the handling methods and thus the viability of the whole process from the perspective of AD patients and their caregivers, as well as to optimize the sensitivity and the data acquisition and power supply method;EN;;Academic

However, current methods of preclinical testing and quality control do not sufficiently assess the effect of prospective drugs on the developmental potential of the human embryo and thus exclude any risk to fertility. As the investigational use of human embryos is not possible for ethical reasons, toxicological testing in animal models is carried out. However, due to significant interspecies differences, it is unclear whether these results are also relevant with respect to human reproduction. The need to expand existing embryotoxicity testing options is particularly acute in the field of assisted reproduction. Here, in vitro culture conditions are being modified to increase treatment efficacy without standardised assessment of the influence of media components and so-called critical materials in direct contact with the developing embryo. The aim of the proposed project is to validate the applicability of an existing in vitro model of human embryogenesis for pharmacological and toxicological testing.  For this purpose, we will make use of a recently published technology that allows the laboratory preparation of 3D structures resembling human embryos at the blastocyst stage (so-called blastoids) from in vitro cultured human stem cells (Fig. 1). The existence of this laboratory system opens up a wide range of applications not only for the research of new drugs and the improvement of in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques, but also for the quality and safety control of products used in current clinical practice.

The unclear cause of the disease, together with clinical heterogeneity, are the main reasons why CVID is often mis- or underdiagnosed.

In Eastern European Medical Programmes taught in English, however, the number of international students has exploded in the last decade, while the number of teaching staff has not been increased reasonably. The teaching workload of academics increased enormously, without meaningful adjustments in teaching traditions sustainable for large heterogenous populations of international students. This has resulted in considerably high rates of mental health-related complaints from both students and academic staff in these Institutions. As the medical profession itself is notoriously linked to a relatively high lifetime risk for mental health and associated chronic diseases, and medical education ought to equip all doctors with skills to cope with these increased risks in a preventive or protective way, strategic investments must target the development of the curricula of foundational years in medical education which should help transform current teaching traditions into a sustainable and efficient training beyond ESG standards. To facilitate achieving this goal, this project investigates a key foundational course subject Human Anatomy for its potential to be repurposed for the above-mentioned sustainability criteria. The key intellectual output of this project will be a guidebook on 'How to Manage Human Anatomy Courses for Internationalized and Sustainable Medical Education'.

Cell death acts as a second messenger, influencing the immune system and the tissue microenvironment to ensure regeneration and homeostasis. The most important subtypes of cell death are apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis and ferroptosis. The distinction between lytic (cell rupture) and non-lytic (apoptosis) cell death induced by agents used in medicine is extremely important information for many areas of medicine. Currently, the widely used biochemical endpoint assays are not accurate enough to distinguish the specific type of cell death, and therefore new more accurate methods are needed. In this project, we will attempt to demonstrate that real-time quantitative phase imaging can provide robust data for deep learning methods. In addition to robust deep learning detection/classification, standard feature extraction techniques will be explored to produce explainable data and a novel feature describing quantitative phase dynamics will be investigated. Simultaneously acquired, cell death-specific fluorescence will be used as a control for subsequent cell death detection and classification from fluorescently unlabeled cells. This approach can provide important information about the cell population after exposure to a particular substance, such as the number of dead cells, and distinguish the major subtypes of cell death that led to their demise.;EN;;Academic

Biofilms are able to colonise both biological surfaces, such as wounds or burns, but also abiotic surfaces, such as medical devices like catheters, heart valves, joint replacements, etc., where they increase the risk of chronic infections.;EN;;Academic

It is based on sensing the electrical activity of the heart by an orthogonal lead system measured by surface electrodes. The lead system does not take into account the influence of the position of the heart and its electrical centre relative to the centre of the orthogonal lead system. This causes a bias in the measured values which will affect further analysis of the measured signals. For vectorcardiograph analysis, it is advantageous to use Laufberger number interpretation, the calculation of which is sensitive to the displacement of the heart's electrical vector. At the same time, interpretation in 3D space using virtual reality can be advantageously used for vectorcardiograph analysis, thus substantially advancing the methodology of vectorcardiography and expanding it in clinical practice.;EN;;student

During the preoperative evaluation, identification of the ""epileptogenic zone"" (EZ) is crucial for its subsequent removal. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, defined in the 80-500 Hz band) have previously been introduced as a promising, interictal (seizure-independent) biomarker of the epileptogenic zone. In recent years, our group has demonstrated the occurrence of very high frequency oscillations (VHFOs, defined in the 500-2000 Hz band) with seemingly higher specificity for EZ than traditional HFOs. This project focuses on basic research on electrophysiological symptoms above the current 500 Hz threshold in a large multi-center dataset. We will use macro-electrodes in vivo, micro-electrodes in vivo and micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) ex vivo to study the generation and propagation of these high frequency events.

Disturbances in the segregation of homologous chromosomes in the first meiotic division are one of the major molecular causes of aneuploidy, which is responsible for infertility and severe birth defects in humans. The construction of the bipolar division spindle in mammalian oocytes is synergistically controlled by chromosomes involved in RanGTP signaling, multiple microtubule-organizing centers that functionally replace the centrosome found in somatic cells, and newly discovered domains around the division spindle, termed liquid-like spindle domains (LISDs). A family of protein kinases, the Aurora kinases, plays an important role in the construction of the division spindle and chromosome segregation. Using advanced live cell microscopy techniques, we will elucidate in more detail 1) the role of LISD-localized Aurora kinase C in meiotic maturation of mouse oocytes, 2) the interaction of Aurora kinases with RanGTP in the construction of the dividing spindle, and 3) how Aurora kinase A regulates meiotic maturation in human oocytes.;EN;;Academic

Deviations in metabolism are therefore one of the key features of tumors and a potential therapeutic target. In prostate cancer, compared to most other cancers, oxidative phosphorylation is still the dominant source of ATP production. Maintaining functional mitochondria is therefore crucial. Prostate cancer cells are also specific in terms of biomechanics; an increase in cellular stiffness compared to non-tumor tissue is typical. Although the properties of the plasma membrane with its associated cytoskeleton and the nucleus are mainly involved in cellular stiffness, intracellular organelles may also contribute to the increase in cellular stiffness. Based on our data, a high degree of cross-linking of the mitochondrial network is evident. In light of the abundance of mitochondria and their high fusion and connectivity rates with the cytoskeleton, it would be surprising if these organelles did not play a role in increasing stiffness. Although this is advantageous in terms of ATP production, it may be a factor limiting migration and invasiveness for cancer cells.";EN;;Academic

If this response is unregulated, it can induce further damage to fine tissue structures or fibroticisation of these structures, subsequently leading to reduced or failed lung function and an increased risk of other lung diseases such as lung tumours, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms that control the response to metabolic stress is important for successful regeneration of lung tissue. In this project, we will use a unique model of expandable lung epithelial cells (ELEP) to interrogate the molecular response of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to metabolic stress, and to understand the dynamics of progenitor cell metabolism during differentiation into functional lung cell types.;EN;;Academic

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by tumor cells may promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and their metabolic shift towards autophagy and aerobic glycolysis. CAFs may promote HNSCC progression, for example, by secreting certain cytokines whose secretion may be involved in autophagy. Modulation of autophagy may affect the amount and content of EVs produced. Several studies have shown that EVs produced by cancer cells expose phosphatidylserine (PS) on their surface. In this project, we want to investigate the role of autophagy in oncogenic communication. The effect of conditioned medium containing EVs (derived from tumor cells with and without autophagy inhibition) on the metabolism of untransformed fibroblasts and CAFs of HNSCC patients will be studied. Furthermore, protein composition of PS-positive EV secreted from tumor cells (with and without autophagy inhibition) and cytokine production in CAFs with high/low basal levels of autophagy will be studied.;EN;;Academic

Mechanical forces are an integral part of the regulatory mechanisms, but their role in mammary gland morphogenesis and tumorigenesis has not been adequately studied. In this study, we will investigate how mechanical force exerted by stromal fibroblasts regulates mammary epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis using 3D co-cultures of organoids with fibroblasts, advanced imaging techniques, mouse models and transcriptomics. The proposed experiments build on our expertise on mammary fibroblast function and our original findings that mechanical force exerted by fibroblasts induces branching morphogenesis of the mammary epithelium and shapes tumor spheroids ex vivo, and that mechanically active fibroblasts are found in the mammary gland in vivo. This research will provide valuable insights into the role of stromal mechanosignaling in mammary gland development, function, and cancer.;EN;;student, employee

In 2018, for the first time, a system allowing the cultivation of TPA-related treponemes under in vitro conditions was published. The primary goal of this project is to use the treponemal culture system under in vitro conditions as a source of live treponemes for the study of genetic manipulation and for the study of the pathogenesis of treponemal infections. We plan to study the genetic transformability of T. pallidum and test basic methods applicable to genetic manipulation of treponemes. In parallel, we also plan to study the interaction of treponem with eukaryotic cells and with extracellular matrix components using chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry methods. In addition, we plan to use antibodies that interact with outer membrane proteins of living treponemes as keys to identify components of the outer membrane of treponemes responsible for the structural and functional properties of pathogenic T. pallidum species and subspecies.;EN;;academic, student

During this process, exons are recognized by the splicing apparatus, excised from the pre-mRNA and rejoined to form mature mRNA. The actual splicing takes place in two consecutive steps (trans-esterification reactions), both of which must be fully completed for the reaction to proceed successfully. However, the efficiency of the two steps varies and is likely controlled by the sequence specificity of the splice sites. It is thought that some donor splice sites undergo the first step but not the second. The splice intermediates thus formed would likely be the substrate for RNA degradation, and this mechanism would thus be responsible for a number of processes occurring in the cell, such as selection of the correct splice site, alternative splicing, or regulation of gene expression. The aim of the project is to distinguish donor splice sites subject only to the first reaction from those subject to both steps on the basis of their sequence. This would have a major impact on the diagnosis of genetic diseases as it would allow the identification of mutations affecting mRNA splicing that otherwise go undetected.;EN;;Academic

So far, three types of these receptors have been identified and characterized - types 1, 2 and 3 - which differ in function. In cancer cells, IP3 type 1 and 2 receptors are known to have antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, whereas the function of type 3 receptors is reversed. The intercommunication and modulation of the different types of IP3 is not yet known. Therefore, the aim of this project is to elucidate the communication of the different types of IP3 receptors in tumorigenesis. We also hypothesize that the mutual communication of IP3 receptors may influence the sensitivity to different chemotherapeutic drugs, which we intend to study in this project. Three types of cancer cell lines will be used in this project - stable cell lines derived from colorectal cancer cells as well as ovarian and breast cancer cells. The results obtained may explain the mechanism of IP3 receptor communication and their role in chemotherapeutic interventions.;EN;;Academic

Recently, we observed an unusual, potentially arrhythmogenic dual effect of the addictive ethanol and the drug aminophylline on IK1 channels in rat heart cells. Our pilot data also showed that low Ba2+ concentrations (common in the population) significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of the drug sildenafil on IK1 in rat cardiac cells and in expressed human Kir2.1 channels. These effects have not been described to date. This project will provide a detailed cross-species analysis of the effects of these agents on rat and human/pig cardiac cells. In addition to recording IK1 and action voltages (AN) in enzymatically isolated adult cardiac cells, complex electrical activity (AN and multielectrode array) of cardiac cells differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (both 2D culture and artificial heart tissue) will be recorded. Not only acute but also chronic effects will be tested.

Recent genomic studies have revealed that pathogenic strains have evolved from commensals and thus E. coli represents a continuous set of strains rather than two strictly separate groups of beneficial and harmful isolates. Resident strains of E. coli are considered non-pathogenic, but share some genetic characteristics with pathogens and are also characterised by long-term colonisation of the human gut. It is therefore important to pay attention to the impact of these strains on host health. The aim of this project is to analyse the impact of resident E. coli on eukaryotic cells and to identify the corresponding genetic markers. To this end, the negative effects of E. coli strains originating from healthy individuals will be tested against several eukaryotic cell lines in vitro.

Here we suggest groundbreaking new concept of stemness being a fluidic ability that can be acquired, modified, or lost under precisely controlled mechanisms. This concept offers a functional substitution of deterministic view of adult stem cells and suggests an unappreciated heterogeneity in stem cell niche by perpetual fluctuation in stem cell behavior. We designed a complex cutting-edge approach to address stem cell dynamics in vivo on the model of continuously growing mouse teeth with a direct translation to regenerative dentistry. To achieve this ambitious goal, we will combine full-length single-cell transcriptome profiling, advanced bioinformatic analysis, in vivo functional validation including multicolor lineage fate mapping or developing a unique system enabling to observe interaction and mutual conversion of stemness niche - stem cell fluidity in vivo. Our findings will have a direct impact on the rapidly developing field of regenerative medicine and will accelerate tissue engineering techniques by understanding intricate behavior of stem cells in vivo and explaining altered behavior of stem cells in vitro.;EN;;Academic

Importantly, the manifestation of cognitive decline is preceded by a long preclinical phase, i.e. the overall disease process is likely to take several decades (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). The failure of hundreds of clinical trials focused on AD treatment highlights the importance of introducing new analytical strategies and novel methods to investigate this disease from a new perspective. In this project, we aim to combine expertise in stem cell biology, single cell sequencing and electrophysiology to map the molecular and physiological initiation and development of AD in brain organoids. We hypothesize that specific genes, molecular pathways, and/or cell types are altered during the early stages of AD and that these previously undescribed changes lead to amyloid accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation. We believe that specific study of the initiation steps of AD could reveal novel mechanisms that could be highly relevant for the prevention and/or treatment of AD in the future.;EN;;Employee

Even though there are methods available to measure the stress resilience, very few tools are available that would make it possible to reliably categorize a population based on the stress resilience of its individuals. This can have consequences especially in high stress situations such as combat scenarios, where it is only after the event where we are able to assess the resilience - however, to prevent the adverse outcome of the high-stress stimulus it is necessary to predict stress resilience before the event actually occurs. Overall, this project focuses on monitoring stress and stress resilience in various scenarios by by established physiological and psychological markers of stress and stress resilience as well as by our novel methodology for stress measurement. Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience. The main goal of the study is to devise a method based on multiple layers of data (physiological markers of stress, neuroimaging, psychological data) making it possible to distinguish between more and less stress resilient individuals.

Thereby, ERK signaling is essential for tissue development, and dysregulation of ERK signaling leads to cancer. But how does signaling activity of one molecule, ERK, defines so many diverse outcomes? Current evidence suggests that the information for very specific cellular responses is encoded in complex spatiotemporal patterns of the activity of ERK molecules - oscillations of various amplitude, frequency and duration, that are only beginning to become understood. It remains largely elusive, how ERK signaling executes the divergent functions during the complex events of organ development and tumorigenesis.

First, it brings an opportunity to establish an interdisciplinary Chem-Bio-Detect consortium of research groups capable of highly competitive research in bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry. Besides the group leaders, postdoc researchers and students for each partner will participate in the project, which will boost their personal development and contribute significantly to their scientific careers. Second, the research project is focused on the tailored development of advanced functional supramolecular anticancer metallodrugs (SAMs) and screening of their biological effects in precise tumor models - namely determination of cytotoxicity and anti-metastatic potential of SAMs using two- and three-dimensional cell culture systems and using animal models in the later stage. Detailed analyses of biological samples for determination of cellular uptake of metals (from in vitro tests), identification of subcellular target(s), and studies of the lateral distribution of elements in tissue samples (from in vivo tests) will provide additional information crucial for the future rational design of more effective and selective SAMs. Following the evaluation of IP protection, the results will be published in top-tier journals. The ultimate goal of the NANOWHEEL project is to set a base for a structure-activity relationship investigation of the developed SAM and establish an internationally competitive research center attracting prestigious research grants and talented young researchers.;EN;;Academic

The bicarbonate ions are transported inside cells, contributing to the maintenance of physiological intracellular pH, while accumulating protons make the extracellular environment more acidic. CAIX is highly expressed in advanced solid tumors, where its activity promotes cancer cell migration and the formation of metastases. It also helps cancer cells to survive under hypoxia and the conditions of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Therefore, CAIX is a highly attractive therapeutic target for developing novel, more effective treatments for advanced human cancers with fewer undesired side effects. The proposed project will combine unique expertise in computational chemistry and biology, structural biology, medicinal chemistry, and cancer biology to develop novel highly selective small-molecule CAIX inhibitors as potential anti-cancer drugs. We will use state-of-the-art molecular modeling and NMR spectroscopy structural biology approaches to study in a wide pH range the functionally essential, but little characterized, intrinsically disordered region of the extracellular domain of CAIX. Subsequent SPR binding analyses will identify its critical structural determinants. Informed by the structural studies and molecular modeling results, the medicinal chemistry group will develop effective synthetic routes for the preparation of selected novel triazinyl-substituted benzenesulfonamides as specific CAIX inhibitors, followed by in vitro activity testing. Analyses of the compounds' biological activity in human malignant melanoma and breast carcinoma cells under conditions representing different bioenergetic/metabolic contexts found in cancer tissues will synergistically complement the whole process. Moreover, the planned analyses of CAIX molecular and functional interactions with other essential regulators of intracellular pH could help to identify conditions under which the cytotoxic activity of CAIX inhibitors towards cancer cells is potentiated.;EN;;Academic

The Czech government reacted swiftly and decisively and implemented a lockdown in mid-March. This helped keep the number of infected very low throughout the first wave of the pandemic. Day-to-day life across the country was thus affected rather by the anti-pandemic measures than by the disease per se. These measures created several natural experiments which we exploit in this project to evaluate various public policies that would be unfeasible under normal circumstances. In the wake of the pandemic, the government introduced a ban on support persons during childbirth and imposed restrictions on outdoor activities. In the first work package, we study the effect of continuous support during childbirth on the health outcomes of mothers and children. Employing the rich health registry data and the unexpected introduction of the ban of support persons during childbirth, we identify the effect of continuous support on health outcomes. Other work packages involve the restrictions imposed on outdoor activities during the lockdown. Such restrictions can be seen as a stand-in for a potential air pollution avoidance policy. However, unlike in other countries, the air quality following the lockdown substantially worsened in the Czech Republic. In the second work package, we thus identify the effect of a potential air pollution avoidance policy using a within-subject comparison of the probability of acute conditions occurring pre- and post-lockdown with a previous comparable period of air pollution increase that was unaffected by COVID-19 related restrictions. In the third work package, we study the effect of air pollution on traffic accidents using the health and Police registry data. The restrictions on outdoor activities imposed during the lockdown enable us to disentangle the effects of air pollution and traffic intensity.;EN;;Academic

Systemic therapy for this disease consists mainly of four drugs - 5-FU, capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The 5-year survival rate for CRC is only 53% in the Czech Republic. Therefore, new drugs and innovative models for their testing are needed. Agents inhibiting signaling pathways deregulated in CRC, such as EGFR/KRAS/BRAF, were suggested for the treatment of CRC patients. However, the success of this targeted therapy depends on the mutation profile of the tumor, the homogeneity of drug penetration, the tumor microenvironment, the cell-stroma interactions, and other factors. The organotypic slice cultures (OTSC) represent a new 3D model for drug testing, comprising not only the individual mutational spectrum of a primary tumor but also other characteristics such as acidity, hypoxia, and intercellular interactions. Derived from a tumor of an individual patient, OTSC is a model of choice for personalized medicine.;EN;;Academic

The personalized treatment procedures are based on detailed examination of the specific disease, its evolution over time (repeated biopsies - clonal evolution), biological analysis and genetic background of the patient. For this purpose, both commercially available and ""in-house"" academic procedures based on molecular biology technologies are used. Data are subjected to bioinformatic analysis, which forms an integral part of these so-called theranostic approaches.    Biological material is analysed by next-generation whole exome/genome sequencing (NGS), transcriptional profiling (RNAseq), detection of receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and detection of specific translocations/gene fusions. The panel of assays has been expanded in the last 2 years to include methylome sequencing, liquid biopsies and MLPA, and low-coverage whole-exome sequencing prior to launch. The information obtained is evaluated in regular expert meetings, the so-called expert panel (""molecular tumor board""), which results in specific treatment recommendations to improve outcomes for patients with high-risk cancers, such as children with refractory and relapsed solid tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL).

Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field in which this knowledge is used to combine stem/progenitor cells with bioactive materials and flow systems. However, the effective use of any stem cell type is completely dependent on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence stem cell behavior, our ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into functional somatic cell types, or our ability to generate and influence the three-dimensional arrangement of stem and progenitor cells. The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, (i) the molecular mechanisms responsible for genetic instability and genetic modifications of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, (ii) methods for isolation and characterization of the extracellular matrix and their impact on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, and (iii) microfluidic systems will be developed to coculture multiple types of stem and progenitor cells, (iv) the involvement of miRNA molecules in controlling differentiation and establishing stem cell plasticity will be investigated, (v) methods for forming 3D cell aggregates and differentiating them into specific tissue types will be developed, (vi) protocols for differentiating hES cells into relevant cell types, in particular epithelial, neural, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, will be further developed. The focus on human stem cells will be newly complemented by experiments aimed at understanding the origin and development of the human embryo, which is closely related to the issue of pluripotent cells and the medical applications based on them. The main experimental approaches will be in vitro manipulation of cells, quantification of relevant mRNAs and proteins for molecular phenotyping of cell populations, and imaging of live and fixed cells using advanced microscopy techniques.;EN;;Academic

The subject of this project is the molecular genetic diagnosis of idiopathic PAS by Sequence capture (SeqCap) and Targeted resequencing (TR) to identify causal mutations, i.e. mutations directly responsible for the development of the disease. The identification of causal PAS mutations is followed by the study of genotype-phenotype correlations, focusing on the current incidence or risk of epilepsy, in an attempt to determine the predictive value of specific mutations in relation to epilepsy. Determining the risk of epilepsy for a given causal PAS mutation is important in terms of initiating preventive regimens and therapeutic interventions in these patients, thus preventing complications, poor prognosis and quality of life in these children.;EN;;Academic

In a unique way, we described the dependence of the ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) value, which is a numerical expression of the diffusivity of water molecules on MRI, with cellularity and vascularity in the peritumoral tissue. Based on these findings, we attempted to delineate areas of brain tissue that is infiltrated by a significant amount of diffusely growing tumor cells leading to restriction of the free movement of water molecules. However, our promising results have a limited level of significance given the limited number of samples. Thus, we proposed a method in which the dynamics of ADC value evolution towards the periphery of tumor infiltration forms the basis for tumor boundary prediction. The extent of tumor infiltration according to imaging methods will be subsequently verified by retrospective analysis of anonymized histological samples obtained topically during neurosurgical procedures. Refining the delineation of high-grade glial neoplasia is currently one of the greatest challenges in the management of these tumors. If our method proves successful, it could contribute to a higher efficiency of surgical and subsequent oncological treatment in high-grade gliomas. The use of the method in the differential diagnosis of other brain tumor and non-tumor entities, where rote imaging methods often fail, could also be beneficial.;EN;;Academic

These are generally available in a few strengths (defined doses), disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences between patients, e.g., genetics, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, biorhythms, or human biotype. Individualised therapy is an area of pharmaceutical research that reflects such differences.  However, to fully develop this concept, there is a need for adequate dosage forms allowing precise administration of drugs. New technologies to produce medicinal products are being introduced, with the emphasis on the flexibility of dosing and high patient acceptability. One group of such technologies are printing technologies - e.g., 2D ink-jet or 3D printing. These may be used for the preparation of thin polymeric films, which provide good compliance and treatment adherence along with high formulation flexibility. Printing technologies ensure the deposition of an accurate dose of the drug into a dosage form while allowing to combine several drugs or fine-tune release kinetics. Although printing may help to fulfil one of the goals of the presented project, bringing the personalisation approach directly to healthcare facilities has still some downsides. These are mainly the lack of a simple user interface for the control of printers and basically non-existent legal framework for the whole process.  Hence this project aims: 1) to verify the application of ink-jet and 3D printing in the manufacturing of oral films, 2) to improve the user-friendliness of 2D and 3D printers control software, and 3) to clarify the legislative framework of the complex issue of individualised therapy.

Choroid plexuses (CPs) of the brain ventricles play a crucial role in brain homeostasis maintenance. Besides the secretion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the epithelial cells of CP form the blood-CSF (B-CSF) barrier, an interface between the circulating blood and CSF.  Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence implying the involvement of the CP and B-CSF barrier in different neurological disorders such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), nerve injury, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and Alzheimer’s disease. However, the B-CSF barrier is among the least studied structures of the central nervous system (CNS) despite its clinical importance. 
Our group has been focused on investigating the pathology and therapeutic potential of the CP and B-CSF barrier using in-vivo and in-vitro (cell lines grown as monolayers on flat surfaces) models. Our in-vitro cell models (Z310 cell line and primary cells) aim to reproduce B-CSF barrier functionality, plus allow for genetic manipulation and enable us to study and control the passage of active component through the barrier in order to understand its properties at the cellular and molecular level. 
In-vitro two-dimensional (2D) culture systems, in general, are simple, fast, and cost-effective; however, the 2D culture system does not resemble the environment in which cells experience in the brain tissue. Therefore, a significant difference between the 2D cell monolayers and in-vivo characteristics has been reported. Impaired cell-cell communication and reduced intercellular contacts are among the limiting factors of a 2D culture. Nevertheless, three-dimensional (3D) systems can capture complex physiological responses and could closely resemble in-vivo conditions. 
The goal of this project is to develop 3D CP epithelial cell culture and 3D blood-barin barrier (BBB) model employing tissue engineering techniques and biomaterials in order to support advanced studies on the structure and function of the B-CSF barrier in physiological and pathological conditions.";EN;;Academic

And while the current body of research supports the concept that protein aggregation initiates the onset of AD, failure of over 413 clinical trials performed thus far that aimed to treat AD highlights the importance of introducing novel analytical strategies and methods to explore this disease from a new unbiased perspective. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to determine which molecules, molecular pathways, and cell types are altered during the initial phase of AD development and use this knowledge to validate markers (and possibly “druggable targets”) of early disease onset. Specifically, we aim to 1) perform single-cell sequencing of our established functional AD-iPSCs-based model of brain organoids in the timeline experiments; 2) use unbiased data analysis to reveal molecules, molecular pathways, and cell types that are altered during the initiation of AD pathogenesis and pinpoint the relevant AD-driver change(s); and 3) evaluate if any of these novel findings could be used as early disease onset marker or possibly as AD drug-targets and perform functional studies of selected molecules. To this date, such single-cell seq analysis of AD-brain organoids has not been performed, nor has any of the available single-cell seq research from post-mortem AD-brains addressed the initial steps leading to the manifestation of AD pathology. Thus we believe that this project could significantly contribute to solving the initial trigger that stands behind the early steps of AD pathogenesis.";EN;;Academic

Thereby, ERK signaling is essential for mammary gland development, including, and dysregulation of ERK signaling leads to breast cancer. However, it remains largely elusive, how ERK signaling executes the divergent functions during breast development and cancerogenesis. We hypothesize that specific patterns of ERK signaling dynamics encode distinct morphological processes during mammary gland development, determine different cancer cell behaviors, and confer differences in therapeutic susceptibilities and prognosis. 
The overall objective of this project is to decipher the ERK activity dynamics code in mammary gland development and breast cancer. To this end, we aim to 1) uncover the ERK activity dynamics patterns during mammary morphogenesis and cancer progression using state-of-the-art bioimaging approaches with highly sensitive ERK biosensors in developmentally and clinically highly relevant in vivo and ex vivo models; 2) decipher the ERK dynamics code by tracking the cellular and molecular outcomes of ERK activity dynamics by analyzing gene expression and protein abundance patterns using non-targeted and targeted approaches; and 3) validate our findings by perturbation analysis using specific inhibitors to modulate ERK signaling in normal and cancer cells. 
The proposed experimental techniques with cellular resolution, ranging from ERK biosensor to single-cell transcriptome and spatial transcriptomic analyses, hold the promise to elucidate the relationship between ERK activity dynamics, morphogenesis and cancerogenesis while considering cellular heterogeneity. Our research collaboration will provide essential, in-depth insights in the basic biology of this crucial signaling pathway during mammary gland development and breast cancer progression. In the era of precision medicine, our findings will shed light on mechanisms of normal and neoplastic breast cell heterogeneity and lead to the development of new rational, tailored treatment strategies and predictions of therapeutic responses for breast cancer patients.";EN;;Academic

Kidney transplantation represents the gold standard for patients with ESRD. After transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs are crucial to reducing the risk for organ rejection. Apart from this desired effect, the compromised immunocompetence of the recipient leads to an increased risk for infectious disease. Moreover current immunosuppression regimens are unable to sufficiently control allorecognition of the graft, which leads to chronic rejection. Thus optimal management of immunosuppressive drug dosing requires a delicate balance between inadequate and excessive immunosuppression. At present, there is no diagnostic test or algorithm for optimal guidance of immunosuppressive drugs. Monitoring relies on the quantification of calcineurin inhibitor, mostly tacrolimus, through levels in the peripheral blood, which correlate more closely with the risk of drug-related toxicity than the immunosuppressive efficacy. There is an urgent need for tools to personalise immunosuppression thereby reducing the risk of infectious disease and, at the same time, graft rejection.";EN;;Academic

The disease is characterized by chromosome fragility, premature aging, developmental abnormalities and predisposition to cancer. RecQ4 participates in several cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA damage response, telomere and mitochondrial maintenance. However, it is not clear which impaired functions of RECQ4 trigger the pathogenic effects. We have identified several novel RecQ4 interacting partners mediated by the conserved N-terminal domain required for cell viability. Here we propose a multidisciplinary set of biochemical, biophysical, structural, cellular and genetic approaches to understand the molecular function of RecQ4 protein in cells and its correlation to disease development. We set three goals to unravel the roles of RecQ4 during replication and resolution of replication/recombination intermediates. Krejci’s lab will focus on biochemical characterization of the above-mentioned protein interactions and their effect on replication initiation and progression, as well as resolution of stalled intermediates in human cell lines. Tripsianes’ group will focus on structural and biophysical characterisation of interaction interfaces and identify separation of function mutants. Silva’s team will nicely complement the biological role of RecQ4 in the C.elegans model system. The proposed synergy promises to dissect RecQ4 multiple functions in genome maintenance, which in turn will offer a better understanding on the development of RECQ4 associated diseases.;EN;;Academic

Even though there are methods available to measure the stress resilience, very few tools are available that would make it possible to reliably categorize population based on the stress resilience of its individuals. This can have consequences especially in high stress situations such as combat scenarios, where it is only after the event where we are able to assess the resilience – however, to prevent the adverse outcome of the high-stress stimulus it is necessary to predict stress resilience before the event actually occurs. Overall, this project focuses on monitoring stress and stress resilience in various scenarios by by established physiological and psychological markers of stress and stress resilience as well as by our novel methodology for stress measurement. Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience. The main goal of the study is to devise a method based on multiple layers of data (physiological markers of stress, neuroimaging, psychological data) making it possible to distinguish between more and less stress resilient individuals.

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the molecular pathology of achondroplasia, and compromises development of treatment for this devastating human condition. 
Our previous work points to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. 
In the proposed research, we will use mathematical modelling and advanced computational analysis to reconstruct the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation, and to predict their behavior. The in silico analysis will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling. 
Unraveling the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK activation will aid development of novel treatments for achondroplasia. Because many other, FGFR3-unrelated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) utilize prolonged ERK activation in their pathological signaling, the theoretic and experimental work proposed here will advance the understanding of general mechanisms of developmental defects, cancer and other disorders caused by aberrant RTK activation.";EN;;Academic

Within this population, poor muscle control, impaired balance and spasticity cause significant motor impairments. To improve locomotion, a surgery is the key part of treatment, whose success strongly depends on a correct surgery indication. However, the selection of the convenient surgery is very difficult and subjective also for expert surgeons. On the other hand, current motion capture systems can accurately measure kinematic, kinetic and spatio-temporal parameters of gait (so-called 3D motion data). A manual analysis of such complex data is practically impossible in huge data volumes. Within this project, we propose to develop a prototype software application for automatic analysis and evaluation of 3D motion data using sophisticated technologies employing artificial intelligence. In particular, we plan to utilize current advances in deep neural networks to learn a locomotion model from 3D motion data of thousands of gait cycles of more than 500 patients operated in the past. The learned model will be used to find formerly-operated patients with the most similar walking patterns. By considering the treatment outcome of these known patients, we could recommend the most suitable surgery option for a new examined patient. We assume that a sophisticated similarity analysis of a huge amount of 3D motion data can be the critical factor in distinguishing patients with a good response from patients with a poor response to a specific surgery, which is not possible to do in any other way at the present time.

For adults, romantic partners are one of the most important social regulators of negative emotions, and experimental studies have shown that partner presence dampens emotional distress and neural reactivity during physical threat and pain. However, the modulating effects of social support during exposure to emotional visual stimuli and emotional imagery are still largely unexplored. Negative emotional imagery and exposure to grief-inducing visual material cause subjective stress and can compromise quality of life. Intrusive mental imagery is further prevalent in patients with mood and anxiety disorders and therefore has been given increasing scientific attention. Both peripheral and central neurophysiological underpinnings of negative imagery and whether these can be modulated has captured interest. Previous studies have used physical threats to induce discomfort, but during ordinary everyday life fantasies and images of aversive situations and outcomes are common and therefore in this project we aimed to study aversive mental imagery and exposure to visual reminders of deceased close person, and the effects of social support given by the attachment figure (romantic partner) and a stranger, on brain activity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), in order to assess the brain function at various levels. Such research is warranted in order to investigate brain reactivity and functional connectivity, that are specific for negative imagery and exposure to negative personal visual material and whether social support by a close person can modulate such potentially deleterious neural activity to this type of stressors. The findings can provide new leads in understanding possible health benefits stemming from social interactions and deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of attachment.

Intrusive mental imagery is further prevalent in patients with mood and anxiety disorders and therefore has been given increasing scientific attention. Both peripheral and central neurophysiological underpinnings of negative imagery and whether these can be modulated has captured interest. One way to dampen stress is to hold hands with an attachment figure, which attenuates both physical and psychological pain possibly through reduced neural activity. Most previous studies have used physical threats to induce discomfort, but during ordinary everyday life fantasies and images of aversive situations and outcomes are common and therefore in this project we aimed to study aversive mental imagery and exposure to visual reminders of deceased close person, and the effects of social touch given by the attachment figure (romantic partner) and a stranger, on brain activity. We used electroencephalographic (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and also the novel functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) technique, in order to assess the brain function at various levels. Such research is warranted in order to investigate brain reactivity, connectivity and neurotransmitter concentration changes, that are specific for negative imagery and negative personal visual stimulation and whether intimate hand holding can modulate such neural activity to this type of stressors that are qualitatively different from previously documented physical threat and threat of pain. The findings can provide new leads in understanding possible health benefits stemming from social interactions and deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of attachment. GAMU grant support will provide us with resources needed in order to finalize the research project and present our findings in leading journals in the field.;EN;;Academic

PARP1/2 double knock-out or null PARG mutant mice die at early stages of embryonic development preventing their study in the germ cells, where physiological induction of DNA damage is essential to promote faithful chromosome segregation. Caenorhabditis elegans PARP1/2 and PARG null mutants are viable and fertile, allowing the unprecedented analysis of their roles during meiosis. We have collected strong preliminary observations that uncover a previously unknown role for PARG in stimulating meiotic DNA double strand break (DSB) formation and in promoting their homologous recombination-mediated repair together with BRCA1. By exploiting the powerful genetics, biochemical and cytological tools provided by the C. elegans system, we expect to shed new light on how catabolism of ADP-ribose influences DSB induction/repair dynamics in the germ cells and to identify the targets of PARG-1 in vivo, a type of analysis never carried out up to date.;EN;;Academic

Functional SORLA keeps the levels of Amyloid-β in the brain in a healthy balance regulating APP processing into Amyloid-β, and by binding excess Amyloid-β to target it for lysosomal degradation. In the past two-three years it has become clear that heterozygous, damaging variants in the SORL1 gene are associated with and possibly causative for AD. Furthermore, the load of pathogenic and risk-increasing SORL1 variants in AD patients is large, which suggests that it is imperative to invest in the identification of those at risk to become affected with SORL1-associated AD, and the selective treatment of affected individuals. In this proposal we have created a collaboration of international investigators who are highly capable of answering the open questions regarding SORL1 variant pathogenicity and protein functions. Within this synergy of expertise, we will generate a working-pipeline to assess SORL1 variant pathogenicity, allowing the accurate diagnosis of patients with SORL1-associated AD and we will invest in the identification of selective SORL1-boosting or SORL1-fixing treatments applicable to individuals affected by compromised SORLA function.;EN;;Academic

It is therefore of uttermost importance to study the actual development of the disease and not only the detectable consequences. Curiously, molecular mechanisms underlying the earliest developmental changes of neurons in AD brains are unknown. Here we aim to study this process using in vitro model of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from patients with familial and sporadic AD. Our expertise will allow us to derive and characterize a set of new iPSCs cell lines, differentiate them into self-renewing neural stem cells (NSCs), and to mature neurons and perform mRNA and microRNA Seq analysis.

The project members made initial contact thanks to the Joanna Briggs Collaboration, which is a not-for profit organization and some project partners are members of this collaboration.
The SPIDER project was developed to address the needs of improving skills of European project partners in EBHC, especially in the translation/implementation and utilization of evidence in healthcare clinical practice. The core idea of the project is to support cooperation and exchange of know-how within the unique Evidence-Based Clinical Fellowship Program (EBCFP) context. Based on the current situation, there is not a completely established educational programme which is focused on evidence translation/implementation into practice in Europe. This means that professionals in healthcare across Europe need to improve their experience and skills with implementation of the research evidence into their practice. It is especially important in this era, when praxis in some healthcare fields lags more than 15-years behind science.

Different vertebrates developed distinct ways how to maintain teeth vitality throughout their lives. Unlike them, human teeth have only limited regenerative and reparative capacity and since the average age of human survival is increasing, dentition is more susceptible to variety of diseases which can ultimately lead to teeth loss. Although modern human dental medicine is able to deal with multiple of dental diseases, the treatment is usually limited to application of inorganic artificial compounds beginning with tooth fillings and in the end leading to application of tooth implants or dentures. Currently there is no clinically routinely used method based on utilization of natural biological processes in regenerative dentistry. In this proposal we suggest completely novel approach how to look at the regenerative medicine in general context by performing experiments on the tooth model system via adopting natural developmental mechanisms for controlling highly specific cell differentiation. Our main practical aim is to produce odontoblasts – a dentin-forming cells, which would be naturally able to repair major hard matrix of the tooth. Recently we gathered important data from our single cell RNA-seq datasets (Dental Cell Type Atlas) from the developing teeth which gave us unique information about transcription factor (TF) code activated during odontoblasts differentiation. Adopting this knowledge we propose new approach to prove the role of TF code in odontoblasts differentiation and validate this hypothesis under both in vitro and in vivo conditions during cells-into-tooth transplantations. This approach may open completely new field of dentistry and in long-term scale can significantly prolong human dental fitness keeping our own teeth healthier and more resistant to dental caries.;EN;;Academic

Even though there are methods available to measure the stress resilience, very few tools are available that would make it possible to reliably categorize population based on the stress resilience of its individuals. This can have consequences especially in high stress situations such as combat scenarios, where it is only after the event where we are able to assess the resilience – however, to prevent the adverse outcome of the high-stress stimulus it is necessary to predict stress resilience before the event actually occurs.  Overall, this project focuses on monitoring stress and stress resilience in various scenarios by by established physiological and psychological markers of stress and stress resilience as well as by our novel methodology for stress measurement. Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience.

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the molecular pathology of achondroplasia, and compromises development of treatment for this devastating human condition. 
Our previous work points to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. 
In the proposed research, we will use mathematical modelling and simulations to reconstruct the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation, and to predict their behavior. The in silico simulations will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling. 
Unraveling the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK activation will aid development of novel treatments for achondroplasia.

More specifically, we will investigate the role of FGF2 signalling intensity, myoepithelial cells and mechanical forces in regulation of mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis. To this end, we will develop and use deep-learning-based pipelines for segmentation and tracking of 3D organoids as well as individual cells in data from time-lapse microscopy imaging and a

The innovation of the IMPULS project is to screen patient´s risk “constantly” through smart wearable mobility/motion sensors in order to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers, hence to increase patient safety.
To generate a large impact, we will integrate our developed smart sensor based digital assistance systems in different health care settings (hospitals, nursing homes, retirement homes, etc.) across Europe. 
Although mobility/motion sensors are common in sports and life-style products (watches) and smart devices and hardware solutions are already available and very inexpensive, this technology has not yet been adopted to fit into the needs of nursing care.

The use of these smart wearable sensors allows further specific objectives:

The main activity foresees a residential experience on July 2019 (from the 8th to the 18th), taking place near Lecce (Italy). Here the international group of participants (30 youngsters) will be involved in different activities, developed through non formal methodologies, following the approaches of peer education and learning by doing: role games, videos, case studies, simulation exercises. During the last days, they'll also create a public health awareness campaign.

Whether the same spatially controlled development occurs in mammals remains under debate. Several studies challenge the traditional view of the mammalian oocyte possessing spherical symmetry suggesting pre-determination based on asymmetrical distribution of maternal factors. Here, we propose to address this long-lasting controversy of mammalian oocyte polarity by leveraging the power of the new cutting-edge techniques cryo-qPCR-tomography and Tomo-RNA-Seq, that we have developed to study the intracellular localization of biological molecules in human eggs. The two techniques have proven exceedingly powerful to elucidate global RNA localization gradients in amphibian and fish oocytes. Based on experience with animal models we apply these tools to analyze human eggs using the position of polar bodies as a determinant of the first developmental axis. This topological expression analysis will determine localization profiles of maternal transcripts related to pluripotency and lineage commitment, and also identify new asymmetrically localized maternal factors. Our study will reveal pivotal aspect of human oocyte development and may, in addition to increasing our knowledge about early human development, have profound impact on a variety of micromanipulation procedures used in human embryology and IVF.;EN;;Academic

Disruption of blood and oxygen supply to the brain leads to neuronal death in the ischemic core within minutes. The hypoperfused tissue surrounding the ischemic core, the penumbra, is at high risk for infarction over time but still salvageable. Neuroprotective bridging, sustaining the penumbra until reperfusion, may widen the therapeutic window, make recanalization treatments accessible to more patients and improve overall IS outcomes. 
As ischemic cell death is primarily mediated by hypoxia, increasing oxygen supply to the penumbra seems THE logical approach. In animal models of IS, normobaric hyperoxygenation (NBHO) significantly increased penumbral oxygen pressure and attenuated brain injury when initiated early after onset of ischaemia and vessel occlusion was transient (35 to 50% infarct volume reduction).
The PROOF project now seeks to demonstrate that NBHO (high-flow 100% oxygen at >45 L/min via a non-rebreather mask, or FiO2=1.0 for intubation/ventilation) reduces infarct growth from baseline to 24 hours compared to standard treatment if administered â‰¤3 hours after onset of anterior circulation IS, in patients with proximal vessel occlusion and salvageable tissue at risk. The study is multi-center, adaptive phase-IIb, randomized, open-label with blindedendpoint (PROBE design).
The primary efficacy criterion will be infarct growth from baseline to 24 hours. Secondary endpoints will be NIHSS 24h, categorical shift in the pre-stroke modified Rankin Score, QoL and cognition at day 90. Potential surrogate biomarkers, health economics and societal impacts will be assessed.
If NBHO proves its neuroprotective potential in this selected population, phase-III trials in all IS patients may be undertaken. Considering its low costs and ease of use, NBHO may impact stroke care worldwide.";EN;;Academic

The main aim of the proposed project is to understand the impact of early life adversity (e.g. early life stress) on self-regulation and reward-related behaviours and to identify protective factors that might buffer the individual from developmental disruptions following early exposure to adversity. We hypothesize that (1) early life stress might modulate the development of corticostriatal and corticolimbic circuitry and increase the risk for maladaptive reward-related behavior in young adulthood, and that (2) preventive intervention focused on self-control and regulation of stress might protect high-risk adolescents (e.g. individuals born very preterm). First, we aim to complement longitudinal data from a prenatal birth cohort with a within-subject design neuroimaging data from young adulthood including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), as well as several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks characterizing one’s ability of self-regulation. Subsequently, we aim to develop a preventive intervention that should improve stress regulation and decrease the prevalence of inappropriate impulse-related behaviours and addiction. Applying these interventions in the high-risk adolescents could help preserve reward-related functions in the prefrontal cortex and other reward circuitry. Effectiveness of the preventive intervention will be tested using a randomized controlled trial. This would allow us to assess the intervention-related changes in adolescents’ behaviour and the underlying physiology and brain plasticity.;EN;;Employee

Clinical samples isolated directly from patients contain massive amount of contaminant human DNA. This fact prevents straightforward TPA sequence analyses. This grant application serves to provide funds needed to finish final experiments for project planning to introduce a new culture-independent enrichment method using methyl-directed restriction endonuclease, which selectively binds bacterial DNA in heterogenous samples. Subsequently, next generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing of paralogous and repetitive regions was shown to be able to reconstruct the complete genome sequences of TPA isolated directly from patients without any biases. Moreover, we applied this new technique to the 26 clinical samples and described different genetics of two distinct subgroups of strains causing modern syphilis.  Accumulation of TPA genetic data will help to select candidate loci for development of vaccine against syphilis.

It is a combination of partners from universities, healthcare centres and hospitals, who are focused on EBHC. The project members made initial contact thanks to the Joanna Briggs Collaboration, which is a not-for profit organization and some project partners are members of this collaboration. 
The SPIDER project was developed to address the needs of improving skills of European project partners in EBHC, especially in the translation/implementation and utilization of evidence in healthcare practice. The core idea of the project is to support cooperation and exchange of know-how within the unique Evidence-Based Clinical Fellowship Program (EBCFP) context. Based on the current situation, in Europe there is not a completely established educational programme which is focused on evidence translation/implementation into practice. This means that professionals in healthcare across Europe need to improve their experience and skills with implementation of the research evidence into their practice. It is especially important in this era, when praxis in some healthcare fields lags more than 15-years behind science. 
The coordinator of this project from the Czech Republic is, together with colleagues from Denmark, the only institution who have trainers qualified to deliver the unique EBCFP, which was developed by experts from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia. JBI is a world leader in the field of EBHC, having developed the unique EBCFP.

Our preliminary data point to a complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels to allow for prolonged ERK activation by FGFRs. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, FGFR interactions of their signaling intermediates, mechanisms governing FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR signal.

Studies have shown that some inhaler types only effectively aerosolize 5-30% of the contained drug. The project MediAir focuses on which influencing physiological and mechanical characteristics exist and how they can be controlled to enlarge effectivity of inhalative drug delivery for individual situations. Based on current research, which is mainly based on in-vivo and in-silico models of the respiratory tract and the human respiration process, a considerable amount of provided drug components are not carried along to the intended site of impact within the respiratory tract. This leads to several deficits of this drug delivery method including situation-specific mostly uncomfortable breathing guidelines for the patients, loss of ineffective but valuable material, special considerations and additional components for children and elderly people. The investigative question focuses on the identification of the influencing parameters for effective drug delivery and how they may be tested to increase effectivity – leading to higher degree of comfort for the patients and less necessary drug components for the producing companies. The testing method will include the use of an actively breathing lung simulator xPULM (integrating multiple lung equivalents, for example also porcine lungs). Within the project, this simulator shall be refined from two perspectives. The mechanical setup will be advanced by including an upper airway model and changeable resistances, with focus on the physiological conditions during simulation including various breathing patterns, flow and pressure dependencies, based on analysed and annotated flow data from the included study population. The used aerosol production units will be characterised prior to the measurement cycles for particle analysis and reference measurements.

Despite these inconsistences there is a great deal of innovation in the teaching of spiritual/person centred care that needs to be captured, shared and built upon to
ensure nursing students are equipped to address the holistic needs of the people they care for. This will ensure the nursing workforce of the future is prepared to address some of the global challenges that are impacting upon international nursing and healthcare.

Its role as a crucial tumor suppressor has been well-established, however its contribution to other processes such as embryonal development has only recently been revealed. Interestingly, p53 has been shown to regulate mesoendodermal differentiation via direct activation of the Wnt pathway and indirect influence of Smad signaling molecules. Such unexpected discoveries suggest that p53 might have other important regulatory roles during human embryonic development. This prompted us to utilize the expertise in our laboratory to explore the protein’s behavior during neuroectodermal differentiation in vitro, using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cerebral organoids. Organoids represent a 3D in vitro model which produces structures reminiscent of the human brain, and it has recently been implemented in our laboratory. To study the role of p53, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete p53 from hESCs and induced the cells to form cerebral organoids. Our preliminary finding showed that the absence of p53 strongly enhances the neural development in vitro and generates cerebral organoids with better neuronal morphology and higher expression of neuronal markers. We therefore aim to explore this phenomenon further. Firstly, using molecular techniques such as qPCR, we will quantify the expression of various neural markers, such as Sox2, β-3-tubulin, Doublecortin and others. In parallel, we will describe possible differences between the growth rate and cell cycle mechanics of wild-type and p53KO (knockout) cells. Secondly, we will functionally visualize the electric potential of the neurons within the cerebral organoids. And lastly, we will initiate experiments to identify molecular pathways responsible for the different p53KO phenotype. Collectively, our findings will aid in completing the repertoire of the enigmatic protein’s actions, as well as potentially unveil completely new pathways taking place during human neural development.;EN;;

Methyltransferases catalyze methylation of histones and non-histone proteins, and play  crucial roles in diverse biological processes, including initiation and progression of cancer. DOT1L was found to be critical for leukemogenesis of several mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) subtypes and represents a suitable target for selective killing of leukemia cells. However, we are not aware of any reports on a role of DOT1L in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, DOT1L is expressed in CLL cells (in-house data from expression microarray) which we very recently found to be considerably sensitive to our proprietary C-nucleoside inhibitors.
The proposed project represents an interdisciplinary (in-house chemistry & cell biology plus external structural biology) approach for preclinical optimization of our proprietary, potentially patentable lead compounds, including their thorough in vitro and in vivo characterization. The project capitalizes i.a. on competitive chemistry know-how: our recently published synthetic route is, to our knowledge, the only reasonably flexible technology for preparation of sufficiently diverse carbocyclic C-nucleosides. Utilizing the newly identified sufficiently potent and selective chemical biology probes for DOT1L and other methyltransferases, we aim to decipher the therapeutic potential of targeting these enzymes in the treatment of selected types of leukemia.";EN;;employee, academic

The current body of research supports the concept that protein aggregation initiates the onset of Alzheimer's disease. However, in spite of the large number of available literature and studies, a mechanism of pathogenesis and potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. Here we apply modern and highly specific analytical techniques to relevant in vitro models able to comprehensively capture all important aspects of the human neuropathology. Implementation of such models to study Alzheimer's disease will allow for proper hypothesis testing and will drive important findings. For that reason, general objective of proposed interdisciplinary and interfaculty project is to develop and apply state-of-the-art analytical methodology to a newly introduced cell biology model to study and potentially elucidate hypothetical mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Specifically, we aim to develop modern analytical tools suitable to determine levels of gangliosides and proteins primarily involved in aggregation. Simultaneously, we will establish an adequate in vitro model based on cerebral organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells, suitable to test hypothetical mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Subsequently, we will apply analytical methodology to the conceptual model exploring the influence of gangliosides on the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Finally, we also aim to challenge the in vitro cellular model with an environmental perturbation (e.g. microorganisms) and capture the resulting pathological impacts in relation to Alzheimer’s disease. We believe that proposed combination of analytical technology with disease modeling using stem cells provides a unique opportunity to bring an urgently needed new perspective the field of Alzheimer’s disease research.;EN;;Academic

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the pathology of achondroplasia and other related conditions, and compromises development of treatment for these devastating human conditions. Our previous work at the field, and preliminary experiments carried out for this proposal, point to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. In this proposal, we will use mathematical modelling and simulations to reconstruct, for the first time, the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation and to predict their behavior. The in silico simulations will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important molecular switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling. 
Unraveling the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK activation will facilitate development of novel treatments for achondroplasia and related conditions. Because many other, FGFR3-unrelated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) utilize prolonged ERK activation in their pathological signaling, the theoretic and experimental work proposed here will advance the understanding of general mechanisms of developmental defects, cancer and other disorders caused by aberrant RTK activation.";EN;;Academic

HR repairs DNA damage by copying the correct genetic information from an intact chromosomal template, which is critically dependent on the recombinase RAD51. To ensure its timely and accurate completion, HR is positively and negatively regulated by RAD51 co-factors and antiPage recombinases. How these HR regulators function at the molecular level remains poorly understood and represents a significant challenge to the field due to the lack of mechanistic resolution afforded by conventional bulk biochemical approaches. We recently pioneered several cutting-edge biophysical approaches to interrogate the HR reaction in unprecedented detail.
Importantly, we demonstrated the power of integrating data from these complementary methodologies to uncover the mechanism of action of the Rad51 paralogs in modulating RAD51 to promote HR. The aim of our proposal is to extend this paradigm to study multiple different HR regulators to gain insights into how they work individually and how they act cooperatively during HR. Deciphering how HR regulators work will provide an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms relevant to carcinogenesis and may present unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention.";EN;;Academic

The objective of oncogenetics is to understand genetic predisposition to cancers and care for persons at risk. Genetic predispositions are often associated with a family history of cancer. However, cancers are very frequent and family histories exist, so a family history of cancer is not synonymous with a genetic predisposition. The purpose of a genetic consultation is to determine the share of family history and possible predisposition. Genetic tests, stills seldom practiced, sometimes confirm a hereditary origin. If an alteration is identified in a family, it can be sought in its relations. This makes it possible to reassure those having no predisposition and following up those at risk.;EN;;Academic

They usually have a rapid and aggressive course and affect not only the patient's life but also the life of those around him. The most important goal of care for these individuals is therefore to cure the disease completely (if possible) or at least to achieve a long-term remission so that the patient can return to normal life. It is therefore necessary not only to recognise the disease early, but also to diagnose it accurately and administer high-quality therapy. A great promise is the introduction of so-called personalised medicine, which allows the patient to tailor treatment to his or her needs, including minimising side effects, while comprehensively assessing the various factors influencing the effect of the therapy in question. Infectious complications are very often part of the treatment - they are even a more common cause of death than the disease itself.

These disorders affect more than 5% of the human population worldwide. Psychiatric illnesses represent a significant and growing socio-economic burden on European populations. Although the development of psychopharmaceuticals has led to significant improvements in the treatment of the most severe disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and major depressive disorder, the effectiveness of treatment is limited. The initiative for bilateral collaboration between Czech and Norwegian scientists brings together the teams of Assoc. Wadeley, as project proponent, and Prof. Glover, as project partner. The scientific team of doc. Wadeley is interested in finding out what causes the devastating psychological states in schizophrenia. Her team has generated neurons from specific patients suffering from schizophrenia using state-of-the-art technology called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Neurons are key brain cells that trigger our thinking and behaviour. The next step in the project is to understand why neurons behave abnormally in schizophrenic patients. Prof Glover's research team has expertise in how neurons communicate with each other at the molecular and cellular level. They also have expertise in stem cell culture. Our proposed bilateral project aims to develop a comprehensive platform of complementary techniques to assess communication between neural circuits and neurons derived from induced stem cells in schizophrenic patients. The outcomes of the bilateral initiative are as follows: 3 phd students and 1-2 junior postdoc scientists will be involved in the bilateral training required to: 1) set up and use the neuron-to-neuron communication platform; 2) gain the practical knowledge required to apply neurodifferentiation protocols; 3) directly compare the different platforms in terms of advantages for speed, throughput, drug compatibility, and potential for cross-application; and 4) transfer knowledge, share experiences, skills, and best practices.";EN;;Academic

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this phenomenon remain poorly characterized. An absence of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK signaling complicates understanding of the pathology of achondroplasia and other related conditions, and compromises development of a treatment for these debilitating human diseases.;EN;;Academic

These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing active FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. In this proposal, we will use mathematical modeling to reconstruct, for the first time, the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation and to predict their behavior. The in silico simulations of FGFR3 signal transduction processes will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important molecular switches and regulators.

Attractive as this concept is, its implementation is conditioned by many facts that go beyond biology. Of particular importance are the following two: a) the availability of non-cellular carrier materials that will support normal cell behaviour, in particular cell division, differentiation and 3D organisation into typical morphological structures; b) the demonstration that tissue engineering is an approach that has the potential to be scalable in terms of economic cost and effect on human (societal) health. This project builds on the unique expertise existing at five MU departments, which gives the opportunity to adequately study and develop the above aspects of tissue engineering. The first aspect, carrier development, will use a combination of polymer wetting and 3D deposition and their plasmochemical modification with functional groups, followed by iterative comprehensive testing of their properties in in vitro systems with cells. An important feature will be that the cells used will be normal human stem and progenitor cells with relevant clinical potential. The second aspect, socio-economic calculation, will use information on the cost of research, development and implementation of possible tissue engineering-based medical and biotechnological approaches. The estimated effects of the results achieved will serve as input for the elaboration of model-based economic cost-effectiveness analyses. The experience gained will result in the formulation of methodological recommendations for refining the methodology of cost-effectiveness assessment in the field of tissue engineering.

In experimental laboratory rat models, it has been found that Paclitaxel administration triggers an inflammatory response in the spinal ganglia, spinal cord and other structures of the central nervous system. Similar changes also occur in chronic nerve injury characterized by induction of satellite glial cell activation, invasion of activated macrophages, microglia proliferation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. The spread of the inflammatory reaction to the various stages of the central nervous system may be via the blood and/or the liquor. Our earlier experiments demonstrated the penetration of labeled dextran from blood and liquor into the spinal ganglion, demonstrating the permeability of the blood-nerve and liquor-nerve barriers to cytokine-sized molecules. We also found that peripheral nerve injury induces cellular changes and increased HLB permeability in the plexus choroideus (CP) of the cerebral ventricles.  ;EN;;Academic

In previous years, extensive research was conducted on the process of assessing non-healing wounds in clinical practice (in acute inpatient care, home care and social service settings).   Based on the analysis of the outcomes of previous projects, gaps were identified not only in the assessment of non-healing wounds, but in particular in the lack of erudition of non-medical direct care workers in wound management and in identifying the risk of decubitus lesions. The quality of care for people with non-healing wounds has been assessed within the framework of JRC projects, but the issue of assessing the psychometric properties of assessment tools has not yet been addressed in the Czech Republic. This paper is thus one of the first of its kind. The project should enable further improvement of the quality of care using foreign experience (especially the work of Prof. M. Ahtial from Finland and the validation of the scale for assessing the risk of decubitus) and their implementation. Particular attention will be paid to the identification of patients at risk of developing decubitus in intensive care and to the assessment of inter-rater reliability of individual tools. This is an intervention project. The project activities build on the professional activities of the project co-proposer (member of the committee of the Czech Society for Wound Management - CSWM, member of the committee of the European Wound Management Association - EWMA) and contacts with the Finnish researcher Prof. Maarit Ahtiala. The aim of the project is to improve the professional competences of general nurses in wound management in intensive care. The project is designed as a multidimensional one, linking specific areas of wound management - prevention and diagnosis of pressure ulcers. It also changes the perspective on the identification of lesion risk. The basis of the process of effective care is the correct determination of risk, followed by diagnosis and appropriate treatment - naming and epidemiological assessment of the phenomenon. Based on the project activities, it will be possible to collect relevant data, to perform clinical and population (epidemiological) assessment in a specific health care facility, to plan and implement educational activities for health care professionals in direct care and to increase the knowledge and skills of health care professionals.;EN;;Academic

For better illustration, the molecule FGF21 has been selected, which is a protein with high potential in health care and therapy of selected diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and related cardiovascular diseases). However, an important limitation for the practical use of FGF21 is its extremely low stability and relatively high cost of production. As it is a relatively new protein whose properties have been described relatively recently, no clear idea has yet been established about the future route of administration to patients. The task of the ESF and LF investigators will be to map the needs of the target markets and the interest of potential consumers in terms of final administration. This information will help the FF to better plan research in the areas of stabilisation, production, and possibly immobilisation, so as to achieve modification of the molecule in line with the end use in practice. The CTT will provide the research team with effective legal and other support towards industrial-law (or other required) protection. This will mitigate the risk of dead-end development branches and will allow the FP to develop a stable FGF21 molecule tailored directly to the needs and purposes mentioned. Work on patent protection will be initiated in due course, eliminating the risk of leakage of confidential information. As a result, the potential for transfer of the researched and innovated product into practice will be greatly enhanced. The concept proposed during the project will be as universal as possible, i.e. applicable to different types of applied research projects. This will ensure that the funds spent on applied research will be used efficiently and directly in relation to what the market and consumer demand.

This complex is involved in the repair of damaged DNA within the nucleotide excision repair pathway, repair of interstrand junctions (caused e.g. by cisplatin treatment) and repair of double-strand breaks (caused e.g. by irradiation) in DNA by homologous recombination. Defects in individual proteins of this complex are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne (CS) syndromes. XPF/ERCC1 has been described to be required for the repair of a number of therapeutic agents including cisplatin. As a consequence, high levels of this complex have been associated with a poor prognosis of response to chemotherapeutic treatment in a number of cancers (e.g., ovarian cancer, non-small cell carcinoma, melanoma), thus predisposing inhibitors of this nuclease to clinical applications. Finally, it has also been described that inhibition of XPF/ERCC1 leads to specific synthetic lethality along with inhibition of ATR and PARP. This principle represents a revolutionary and unique pharmacological target for genetically defined tumor types.;EN;;Academic

By appropriate inhibition or activation of these proteins by drugs, pathological processes could be inhibited or desired processes could be promoted. However, the development of such drugs is very costly because the investigational substance must pass through all phases of laboratory and clinical testing to determine its pharmacokinetics, toxicity and specificity. However, it is rarely possible to develop a specific, non-toxic inhibitor of a given mutant form of a particular kinase. Thus, there are many chemicals that have not proven to be specific inhibitors of a particular kinase, and for which much money has already been invested in their development. and other drugs whose development has been halted at various stages because, of the entire family of tyrosine kinases, the drug needs to target only one particular enzyme or only one mutant form of that enzyme. Because RTK signaling is involved in controlling cell proliferation and migration, mutations in RTKs often manifest themselves in the development of cancerous tumors. Testing the specificity of a therapeutic under development is a key step in its development, verifying the effect of a given chemical on the activity of the targeted kinase as well as on the activity of related enzymes in different cell types. Our laboratory has developed a plasmid library of 331 RTK receptors and their mutants that have been associated with more than 50 human diseases. This set in its breadth represents a globally unique set of all receptor kinases on which the specificity of potential therapeutics can be tested. We have also developed a luciferase reporter to read out the activity of one RTK signaling pathway, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway. Since almost all RTKs signal in the same way, it is likely that this reporter will detect the activity of other RTKs as well. The aim of the project is to modify the existing FGF reporter to be able to read the activity of all RTK receptors and to introduce specificity testing of RTK inhibitors using the reporter and the RTK library.;EN;;Academic

However, as in other fields of medicine, a new paradigm of personalised medicine is gaining significant traction in rare diseases, where personalisation is defined as the use of both disease-specific and patient-specific characteristics. The range of applications of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) is expanding at a tremendous pace. The introduction of ATMPs into orphan disease therapies appears to be a very innovative and promising approach that needs to be validated in a clinical trial setting. Using the principles of personalised medicine, ATMPs, especially monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors, are used in the treatment of paediatric cancer patients. Childhood cancers can also be seen as rare diseases. However, ATMPs are only registered for the adult patient population and are thus used off-label in paediatric oncology. There is very little clinical evidence of dose correlation, therapeutic concentration or anti-tumour effect of these treatments in children. There is a complete lack of information on the issue of adverse effects of these drugs in paediatric cancer patients.

Surgical treatment is the only potentially curative treatment with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%. Less than 10% of patients with synchronous JMCC undergo liver resection. The traditional treatment approach (primary first approach) is to remove the primary tumour in the first instance and resect the metastases after systemic treatment. The disadvantage is the time delay from the diagnosis of JMCC to their resection. An initially resectable lesion may become unresectable. Simultaneous resection of the primary tumor and liver metastases is burdened with higher perioperative mortality. In the last decade, another approach has emerged with the intention of increasing the resectability of JMCC - liver first approach (LFA). In this case, neoadjuvant systemic therapy is followed by liver resection. This is followed by adjuvant systemic therapy and finally resection of the primary tumour.

Acute intestinal ischemia (acute mesenteric ischemia - AMI) is one of the most serious. The reported incidence of AMI after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) resection is 3% for elective and up to 60% for emergent procedures, with a mortality rate of up to 90%. Early detection of AMI is absolutely essential to initiate treatment while the condition is still reversible. Clinical diagnosis of AMI is very difficult, and there is no specific laboratory marker. Diagnostic imaging methods are limited by sensitivity and specificity. Angiography and colonoscopy are invasive, limited in availability and not always feasible. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and microRNA are new technologies potentially suitable for early diagnosis of AMI.

These tumours are often pseudohypoxic and may therefore exhibit a number of changes in cellular homeostasis and metabolism. It is known that hypoxia modulates calcium transport and also that Ca2+ signaling pathways are remodeled or deregulated in tumors, and these changes in cellular physiology distinguish them from non-tumor tissue. This remodeling or deregulation of Ca2+ signaling pathways may represent a mechanism by which cancer cells resist systemic anti-tumor defense mechanisms. Thus, the aim of this project is to study changes in gene expression of Ca2+ transport systems in clear cell carcinoma samples compared to healthy kidney tissue. The physiological/pathophysiological consequences of these changes will be studied in vitro in RCC4 and CAKI1 stable cell lines, both derived from clear cell renal cell carcinoma.;EN;;Academic

Imatinib, a selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, represents the first-line treatment for most patients. The second-line drugs are the much more effective higher-generation TKi (dasatinib and nilotinib, or ponatinib). Especially nilotinib, but also imatinib, show adverse vascular toxic effects. The aim of this project is to define the factors associated with vascular toxicity of the TKi imatinib and nilotinib in in vitro and in vivo experiments in order to determine the ability of TKi to induce endothelial dysfunction and the mechanism of its occurrence (contribution of NO, reactive oxygen species, ER stress and autophagy/apoptosis) by a comprehensive approach.

A large proportion of women exhibiting certain clinical signs of preterm birth will, however, eventually deliver in term, while only a smaller proportion of pregnant women (mainly those with premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM)) inevitably delivers in a short time after first clinical presentation (< 7 days). Currently, no biomarkers are available to distinguish between women who will deliver < 7 days after clinical presentation/hospital admission for PTB and those who will deliver later. Adipokines are a family of proteins predominantly secreted by adipose tissue that play an important role in physiology as well as pathophysiology of pregnancy. Specific expression profiles in context of the genetic background as well as metabolic profiles thus may provide potential biomarkers of PTB.

One of the most common factors that lead to HF is heterogeneous structural changes in heart tissue caused by myocardial ischemia or other cardiac disease, which result in so called dyssynchrony between right and left ventriclesor between particular parts of left ventricle. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is a powerful tool for improving the symptoms and reducing mortality in patients with HF. Depending on the character and severity of heart electromechanical abnormality, different treatment techniques can be applied, one of them is electrical stimulation. However, some limitations of electrical pacing cannot be removed because of principle of the approach itself. Alternative stimulation techniques based on UV or visible light illumination in combination with genetic modification of the tissue (so called optogenetics), high-intensity ultrasound pulses, and infra-red laser illumination have been examined under experimental conditions and most recently in human in case of ultrasound-based CRT. In contrast to the electrical pacing, the optical approaches would provide some important benefits such as: high precision of stimuli localization and, hence, more physiological pacing and reduction of the affecting the nearby tissue, absence of pacing artefact in ECG which is important for performing of analysis of QRS complexes or ST segments and, finally, possible recording of the heart electrical activity in close proximity to stimulated area which would be useful for improvement of today's and development of new diagnostic, treatment, or surgical techniques.;EN;;Academic

Recent studies revealed increased expression of various H2S producing enzymes in various cancer cell types, which points to a new role of H2S in the pathophysiology of cancer. However, exogenous H2S plays important and specific roles in many physiological and pathological activities as well. Its effect is dose dependent. At low concentrations, H2S shows cytoprotective effects while at high concentrations H2S has cytotoxic effects, such as stimulating apoptosis and cell death. Slow sulfide donor GYY4137 significantly induced death in some cancer cells by decreasing glycolysis and lactate overproduction. Thus, GYY4137 administration can be considered a novel and selective anti-cancer strategy.

To protect the genome, hPSCs have increased base excision DNA repair (BER) and homologous recombination (HR) activity, while the activity of non-homologous DNA end joining and microhomology-based alternative splicing (MMEJ) remains constant. Our hypothesis proposes that clusters of oxidative damage to DNA bases are converted via BER into double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are further repaired error-free by rapid MMEJ, while pluripotency-controlling proteins cooperate to protect DNA ends from HR and NHEJ. Adapted hPSCs, also use this combination of pathways to repair DSBs induced by increased replicative stress. The result is misrepair and increased mutation frequency of hPSCs. The aim of this project is to test this hypothesis and to show that chemical redirection of double-strand break repair from MMEJ to HR in adapted hPSCs can reduce mutation frequency, allowing longer and more efficient cultivation of pluripotent stem cells.;EN;;Academic

We expect that the role of the hydrogen pick-up, as observed recently for NiTi-based alloys, is generic and may affect the ion release rate also in other types of metallic materials. Moreover, data on combined effects related to ion released kinetics from more than one metallic part are completely missing. A crucial factor to investigate with respect to a save alloy performance after multiple implantations is the link between the ion release rates from the individual alloys and the reactions of the living tissues. Therefore, a special attention will be paid to a cellular protein and miRNA production in relation to the metal ion release.;EN;;Academic

Despite known risk factors contributing to primary hypertension (e.g. obesity or diabetes mellitus), the actual pathogenetic mechanisms are not well understood. On the other hand, there is a group of secondary hypertensions where the secondary increase in blood pressure is conditioned by clearly defined insults.";EN;;Academic

Exosomes carry a plethora of molecules, a very interesting group of which are microRNA molecules whose exosomal content could differ between the different subtypes of hypertension, causing significant changes in the transcriptome of cells involved in blood pressure regulation (e.g. cardiomyocytes, kidney cells, etc.).;EN;;Academic

How is the sequential process of formation of these diverse cell types regulated in the human brain? What are the molecular mechanisms that govern cell fate decisions in our brains? These questions remain to be clarified. Our unpublished data indicate that the RHO/ROCK signaling pathway plays a key role in driving regulatory pathways that control cell specification during brain development. This proposed project aims to investigate how RHO/ROCK signaling controls the sequential production of neural stem cells, and to further elucidate the role of the RHO-ROCK-AKTIN regulatory axis in neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons) during brain development.;EN;;Academic

RNDr. CSc.;698;Implemented by;01.01.2016;31.12.2016;Recipient;MU / GA MU / Category A - Student research projects;LF;Institute of Anatomy;In humans, there are 54 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that respond to extracellular signals mediated by more than 100 ligands. Because each cell responds to many different stimuli simultaneously, there must be specific intracellular mechanisms of RTK signaling that allow cells to respond precisely to their environment. Detailed characterization of these mechanisms is one of the major challenges of modern biology. Recent findings demonstrate that unrelated RTKs can interact and activate (transactivate) each other. Although these unusual RTK interactions play an important role in the mechanisms of RTK function in the organism, they remain the least understood area of RTK signaling to date. The aim of the proposed project is to identify most of the existing transactivations between human RTKs. We will then define the molecular mechanisms of RTK transactivations and determine the functional consequences of transactivations for RTK signaling in cells. Characterization of RTK transactivations will deepen the fundamental understanding of RTK function and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of tumors caused by pathological RTK signaling.;EN;;Academic

It is often very difficult to identify the causative organisms of these infections without amplification or culture within hours to ensure optimal antimicrobial therapy. The proposed project envisages a novel method of preconcentration, pre-separation of selected microorganisms including viruses from real clinical samples using newly developed phenotypic electrofocusing techniques and their subsequent analysis using electrophoretic techniques. The obtained information on the characteristic surface properties of whole cells together with subsequent on-/off-line analysis by MALDI-TOF MS will be used in the identification of pathogens under simultaneous control by PCR. The results will be compared before and after their cultivation together with a comparison of the properties of cultured microorganisms and those collected from clinical samples. The end result will be to propose a new methodology for rapid identification of pathogens of serious infections.;EN;;Academic
