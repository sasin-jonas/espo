We are looking for a partner to complete our consortium: Our objective is to produce a protein sequencer with better resolution and sensitivity than current Mass Spectrometry (MS). Our device would not have the same throughput than MS to detect biomarkers known for example from a database (biomarkers for which MS/e is known) but we would be able to sequence ex-novo proteins and for example, detect the sites of post-translational modifications using a cost-effective device. We currently have a strong consortium of material scientist, people working in the biosensing community and in protein production that have an advance draft of the proposal. We are looking for a partner with a clinical application that could take advantage from our device to mount a case study with proven clinical relevance where our device would have an advantage to provide an application, which today cannot be done with current methods. Ideally the partner should be able to prepare the protein assay with smart digestion and purification of the proteins to isolate peptides of ~30 amino acids whit the relevant fragment to sequence.;

However, their full potential has not yet been reached, as evaluating the immense data generated by a single person is unfeasible to health practitioners. Moreover, currently available wearable data processing algorithms fail to incorporate data on the medical history of each individual.AI models promise to overcome the data burden problem with knowledge extraction capabilities. Nevertheless, current approaches present limitations that hamper their wide acceptance by the medical community. While better-than-human performances have been reported in some specific tasks, models have problems when generalising to unseen scenarios or when input data changes even slightly, often leading to poor results in the real world, such as high false positive rates. Also, even though practitioners resort to multiple sources of health data for evaluation, multimodal approaches often disappoint when compared to single-source algorithms. Furthermore, life-long monitoring generates highly variable data from subjective medical decisions and equipment diversity, which is not fully considered by current algorithms. On top of these problems, ethical and trustworthiness issues arise from some solutions in the literature, which lack the required reliability for real scenarios.A paradigm-changing solution for continuous healthcare needs to attend to such concerns, widening the evaluation of sensory and clinical data to the expectably changing patient conditions and available information with reliability and ethical sense.In this EIC Pathfinder Challenge, we propose to research new methods to increase the robustness of AI models for the continuous and pervasive monitoring of health conditions. Resorting to a holistic perspective, where past and current multimodal data are leveraged, models will be able to provide more reliable predictions. The effective combination of continuous sensor data from wearable devices and medical records is the key to the healthcare continuum.Improving performance is not enough to push standards forward, which is why we intend to dedicate efforts to increasing the trustworthiness of medical AI. Involving the medical community from the technology conception stage we intend to create accessible tools for decision monitoring and visualization by practitioners, including techniques related to explainability and uncertainty estimation.Fraunhofer Portugal AICOS seeks partners to develop a robust and reliable solution for more complete and continuous monitoring of health conditions. Our experience includes projects related to the follow-up of cardiothoracic surgery and monitoring of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients. Therefore, we are searching for partners dedicated to wearable sensors manufacturing, multimodal sensor data collection from wearable devices, integration of clinical data, and end-user stakeholders.PARTNERS ROLES: Fraunhofer Portugal AICOS:- ­Design and development of the Artificial Intelligence solution for health conditions monitoring- ­Research and development of tools for Trustworthy AI- ­(User research)­- (Project management)Wearable Development Partner:­- Research and development of new wearable solutions, including hardware and communication (considering proposed barriers to overcome)­- Discuss and plan certification as medical device­- (Design and development of the solution infrastructure for interoperability between health and wearable data, AI framework and visualization – we may search for a specific partner)Use Case Partner(s):­- Set objectives and disease use case­- Co-design decision monitoring and visualization tools­- Provide medical data for multimodal algorithms­- Implement pilot to test the developed solution;https://crowdhelix.com/uploads/post_attachments/631720cb1c877_Concept%20Note.pdf
14;Welcome to the In Silico Trials Helix - join us!;https://crowdhelix.com/opportunities/welcome-to-the-in-silico-trials-helix-join-us-2209;Alejandro Frangi;VPH Institute;https://crowdhelix.com/organisation/vph-institute-10801;Health, Announcements, In Silico Trials;;Helix members;"Dear Crowdhelix members,We are pleased to invite you to join the new In Silico Trials Helix to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in healthcare. With regulatory success rates of new medical products declining and clinical trials cost rising, innovation of medical products is stagnating despite increasing demand and technological innovations. Clinical trials in Europe, the US and the UK are moving abroad with lower costs. However, patient profiles, regulations and quality assurance may differ from those relevant to ensuring patient benefit in each geography. One reason for failure is that traditional trials aim to establish efficacy/safety for most subjects, rather than individual subjects, so efficacy is determined by a statistic of central tendency for the trial. Traditional trials do not adapt treatment to covariates of subjects, so so-called Precision Medicine becomes elusive. Many reports have pointed to this broken/slow innovation system and its impact on societal costs and suboptimal healthcare. However, radical changes to this innovation process are still to be developed. Dealing with the extraordinary multi-scale complexity and variability intrinsic to human biological systems and health data requires radically new approaches compared to methods for manufactured systems. Computational Medicine (aka in silico medicine) is an emerging discipline devoted to developing quantitative approaches for understanding the mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease through the systematic application of mathematics, engineering, and computational science.The In Silico Trials Helix aims to amplify visibility and international collaboration among all in silico stakeholders. To do so, this Helix, led by the University of Leeds and KU Leuven, works with broader global and national initiatives like the Virtual Physiological Human Institute, InSilicoUK and the Avicenna Alliance. We are convinced that in silico medicine and in silico trials, we can help address these problems and transform healthcare for the benefit of patients, healthcare systems, and the associated sector. Recent developments in patient-specific computational simulations have enabled in silico trials to predict the safety and efficacy of novel drugs, medical devices, or other treatments as part of the research and development life cycle. Some benefits of in silico trials include: (i) enabling more evidence to be obtained before the bench or animal studies are started; (ii) extending the trial cohort to rare, extreme or difficult-to-recruit patient phenotypes; (iii) directly comparing two alternative treatments in the same virtual population (reducing the observed effect variance); (iv) evaluating devices under practically challenging physiological conditions that could represent extreme but plausible applications (off-label use); and (v) reducing the number of animals and humans required in trials, and the refinement of long-term studies to minimise suffering. Studies are beginning to demonstrate that human in silico drug trials demonstrate higher accuracy than animal models, accuracy higher than animal models.Worldwide industry representing medical devices, pharma, and simulation, as well as professional societies, academia, and regulators, are heavily engaged in driving innovations in computational modelling and simulation into regulatory science, promoting methods and processes delivering best in class in silico evidence, and engaging with patients to listen and communicate with the broader community on concerns and potential benefits of this approach. The US has actively developed partnerships between the FDA and Industry, particularly via the Medical Device Innovation Consortium. Internationally, both the Virtual Physiological Human Institute and the Avicenna Alliance take on this role as connector between different stakeholders, preparing the path from the computer screen to the patient.For further information about the In Silico Trials Helix, visit https://www.crowdhelix.com/hel... and click “Follow” to become an active member.

Anthrax is caused by the spore-forming bacteria Bacillus anthracis and causes high mortality in unvaccinated domestic and wild herbivores and can also be transmitted to humans. Anthrax spores can survive in the environment for decades, making control and eradication challenging. Animal vaccines have proven to be an effective control measure in areas which can afford to deploy them. In areas that cannot, recurrent infections are an on-going problem and represent an eco-system from which vaccine resistant variants could emerge and spread. In addition, climate change has seen the recent re-emergence of the disease in regions such of Siberia where spores had previously been trapped in the permafrost. It is possible that some of these spores represent naturally occurring vaccine resistant variants. Laboratory data indicates that variants of the pathogen differ in their ability to infect animals and in some cases defeat vaccines. Given that the pathogen is not thought to replicate outside of an infected host the mechanisms by which mutations occur is unclear but sub-clinical infections may play a role. Given the negative consequences of the emergence of a vaccine resistant strain on animal and human health there is a need to better understand the biology and genetics of B. anthracis to determine the potential for the emergence of naturally occurring strains. We will employ a combination of whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics to screen naturally occurring mutants in historical samples for the presence of mutations which effect virulence and vaccine sensitivity. Using an array of immunological tools, we will screen unvaccinated cattle for evidence of subclinical infections in the form of toxin specific antibodies and will assess their specificity and ability to confer protection against re-exposure to the pathogen. The results will give us a better understanding of the ability of the pathogen to mutate and will provide information to underpin the development of next generation vaccines.We are seeking a research partner to transition the vaccine targets developed by the other consortium members into viable vaccine candidate.The ideal partner would have a track record of manufacturing and developing animal vaccines including anthrax vaccine.More information can be found here: https://www.era-learn.eu/netwo...";

, ";Diagnostics, Disease prevention, Ai for healthcare, Cardiovascular diseases;We would like to join a consortium preparing a project proposal on this topic. Brief explanation of our technology and its stage below:Kelvin Health (https://kelvin.health - short product video as well) is developing an innovative technology for population-wide screening and monitoring of Peripheral Arterial Disease, based on Thermography AI imaging.We apply a mobile thermal imaging camera that captures the body thermodynamics and generates a series of thermograms, which are then thermally segmented, and analyzed temporarily using an ensemble of AI image recognition algorithms trained to detect anomalies related to the vascular system. The use of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks and in particular, convolutional neural networks, allows for robust and continuous discriminative learning of the typical pathology of PAD and CLI.This approach is backed by the fact that local body temperature is directly related to blood flow and a prominent change is caused by either an inflammation, an increased metabolism, a spasm, or a change in the vascular system. Applying temporal AI analysis on a series of local thermal images allows for a precise detection of blood flow blockages that would otherwise be identified using highly-invasive and costly methods such as the X-ray Angiography or methods that are unreliable unless a rigorously trained specialist is applying them such as Doppler Ultrasound. Ironically, existing diagnostic methods also bear a high risk of false negatives for patients with diabetes (highest risk group), due to their higher pain tolerance and mostly because the presence of Medial Arterial Calcification.We now build a thermograms' dataset in collaboration with several national and foreign HCPs. Top medical specialists in the field annotate these thermograms to the golden X-ray Angiography standard plus demographic and clinical patient data. The dataset currently consists of 950+ thermograms on which we achieve 100% sensitivity (always spot an anomaly) and 94.4% specificity (few false positives).We are also prototyping the first medical-grade mobile thermal camera in the low-price tier range and with focus on human body thermodynamics, in collaboration with leading regional manufacturer of optical and thermal hardware, active in military, space and healthcare verticals.Next step is to enrich the dataset and conduct a standardised technology validation multi-centre clinical trial for market approval.Kelvin Health is a spin-out company of Imagga Technologies - global pioneer in AI image recognition space with experience in Horizon 2020 as a technology provider.For more information about the call, please see https://www.ihi.europa.eu/site...;https://crowdhelix.com/uploads/post_attachments/6295db569c5a3_Kelvin%20Health%20-%20Observational%20study%20-%20samples.pdf

As opposed to other biophysical methods investigating the behavior of proteins, they are able to provide an exquisitely molecular view of biological events, which is often a mandatory step towards medical and pharmaceutical applications. They use this approach to unveil the secrets of how proteins govern the core cellular functions and, essentially, make life possible.Their ability to provide a molecular view of biological processes makes their approach extremely valuable in understanding the mechanism of such processes, and, ultimately, ways to intervene and influence them.

We are interested also in cardiac magnetic resonance and its possible applications as a safe, accurate and reproducible method to evaluate structural and functional cardiac modifications in response to medical and/or interventional therapies in the setting of coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. We have good clinical expertise in the field of congestive heart failure patients and in our practice we support innovative and effective food and nutrition approaches as a fundamental part of congestive heart failure treatment.As a cardiologist group we have clinical competence on medical management of congestive heart failure patients, ranging from outpatients to intensive care unit patients.In our institution we already collaborate with laboratory medical doctors and biologists in the study of metabolic and inflammation markers of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. Moreover, we routinely work together with endocrinologists and dieticians in obese and diabetic patients to integrate nutritional and behavioral interventions with drug therapies.Our good competence in cardiac magnetic resonance could be useful to evaluate in a reproducible and reliable way the potential effects of a specific diet on obese patients with congestive heart failure.From the functional point of view, we could analyze the effects of a specific diet on the patients exercise capacity.We propose to analyze the effect of a ketogenic diet in ambulatory obese patients with congestive heart failure in comparison to standard diet. We will set a prospective randomized multicenter study to analyze the effects of the ketogenic diet in the context of congestive heart failure from the radiological, biochemical and functional point of view. We will determine by serial cardiac magnetic resonance (without contrast) the functional and structural cardiac modifications after 3 months of a ketogenic diet compared to standard diet in obese patients with congestive heart failure. With the collaborations of biologists and endocrinologists we will determine the effects of a ketogenic diet on new endocrine and metabolic laboratory markers as well as clinical congestive heart failure laboratory markers. Moreover, we will determine the functional modifications induced by the ketogenic diet in terms of exercise capacity and patients’ wellbeing. By this hypothesis-driven study and by an integrated research approach we aim to a better understanding of human physiology, metabolic regulation and of the links between nutrition and health and disease development. In particular, we aim to focus on the potential therapeutic effect of specific diet nutrition on obese patients with congestive heart failure.;

Reports so far indicate that although platforms like social media have become critical in information dissemination, false information is constantly being spread. How do we ensure that such vulnerable persons have access to reliable sources of information, and can make decisions based on accurate information to slow the spread?The most effective precautionary measure by governments has been to encourage social distancing through lockdowns. In Ghana, the government is experiencing challenges controlling low income households (who are mainly involved in the food value chain) to comply with Stay-at-Home orders in the wake of no income and inability of the government to meet basic needs. What will be the long-term socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on the vulnerable and how can negative impact be reduced? Research objectives: 1. To identify linkages between access to high-quality information and reduction of infection rates through efficient information/ knowledge dissemination concerning COVID–19 especially to the vulnerable segments of society including the urban poor, rural communities, physically challenged in order to ensure inclusiveness in access to information.2. Identify locally available technologies that can be scaled-up to ensure prevention and treatment of the disease.3. To identify the anticipated sociocultural impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable segments of society and identify mitigation measures to forestall negative impacts.Activities:Youth Path Organisation has the capacity to do the following:- Ensure information/knowledge on COVID-19 is disseminated to vulnerable communities through the identification of effective public education and awareness creation activities to reduce transmission rates, avoid myths and secure public confidence;- Empower communities to take local and sustainable action to reduce COVID-19 community spread and related impact through the engagement of community-based leadership structures;- Stimulate local innovation and skill in the development of locally contextual technologies such as Sensor-based taps on Veronica Buckets, contact tracing softwares;- Monitor recovered persons and reduce the stigma associated with affected persons and relatives whiles using their experiences as a vital tool in the achievement of public education and provide support systems for stigmatised persons;- Project and track the short, medium and long term socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 and its associated measures through models and earnings of households.Call details: https://www.edctp.org/call/mob...";

However, there is a territorial inequality as hospitals with the highest capacity are concentrated in the main urban centres and areas far from them are more exposed to the burden of the health system. Developing European strategies to ensure equity of access to the health system and maximise benefit when resources are scarce is key. Health crises may be best addressed from a centralised regional command centre capable of facilitating rapid and coordinated responses but evidence on this issue is limited.Catalonia is a southern European region of 7.5 million people. Health resources are concentrated in the Barcelona metropolitan region. During the pandemic, the Emergency Medical System of Catalonia has coordinated the demand for inter-hospital transport of severe COVID-19 patients and the available health resources from a single, centralised health coordination centre. Our research group has developed and prospectively validated a critical event predictive tool for triage and prioritisation of inter-hospital transport when the referring hospital does not have the necessary resources.We offer our experience and our study cohort for research on improvement strategies exportable to all European regions.

RHD is one of the most neglected poverty-related diseases. Damage to heart values is characterized by stiffness of the valves, eroded, fibrocystic, and the tissues becoming loose and flappy. Although RHD is uncommon in high-income nations, it continues to wreak havoc on the populations of low- and middle-income countries, affecting individuals from elementary school age to late adulthood. Millions of people are needlessly affected by this disease.What if this tragedy is avoided with a simple diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, preventing them from developing RHD in the first place?What if they can be put on secondary prophylaxis for rheumatic fever at grade school after detection of RHD using an affordable assessment?We plan to build a mobile phone-based machine learning (ML) tool that accurately detects at the earliest stage of RHD. This would be in line with the recent WHO-RHD task force recommendation, which calls for developing a timely, inexpensive, and reliable detection tool. Therefore, it enables a non-medically trained person to screen for RHD in RHD-endemic countries before significant damage to the heart valves has occurred.A comprehensive collection of RHD heart sound and ECG data were collected from 124 people with rheumatic heart disease and 46 healthy control subjects at an Ethiopian university hospital. The ML - algorithm that can screen for RHD has been developed with a sensitivity of over 90% at different prevalence rates. The initial developments are based on a collaboration with the Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia on this topic.

, ";Deep learning, Clinical expertise, Sound modelling;Current partners (engineers for UAntwerpen and medical staff pediatrics UZA) have developed an algorithm for the detection of adventitious lung sounds recorded with a digital stethoscope.Methods for analysis of these recorded breath sounds have evolved rapidly over the years. Nevertheless, the application by clinicians is limited to data collection for research and has not been successfully implemented in clinical practice to date. One of the barriers is the lack of real-time analysis and simple reports, which can be interpreted by physicians and other health care professionals without computational background. The outcome of the developed algorithms is generally focused on whether or not malicious lung sounds can be detected. Although these results are very informative, the exact origin of the malicious sounds cannot be determined when using a single-lead electronic stethoscope. At best, a very coarse spatial localization within the receptive field of the stethoscope head can be made. Knowledge of the source localization, however, increases the understanding of the pathophysiology of the individual patient and will lead to an optimized treatment plan.We want to develop a multi-lead auscultation system that can localize the sounds source/ area within the lung. Based on sounds from the multi-lead recordings that will be combined. Hence a suggestion is made to the treating clinician or therapists by means of a 3D projected sound image. By making a robust low-cost system this would allow a patient to use the multi-lead stethoscope at home whilst the care giver can evaluate remotely whether or not the patient should seek contact with a specialist for further follow-up. It is complemented with digital and AI-based technologies for providing user-friendly alerts and predictions.Partners have experience and track record in signal processing and clinical studies.We are looking at onboarding additional or joining efforts with partners who have knowledge in sound propagation modelling, deep learning for medical applications and expertise in clinical use of digital lung sounds. Sought expertise:- Identification and characterization of sources and sounds linked to specific diseases or airway abnormalities by using AI models, sound propagation modelling and developing simulation models- Study on effectiveness of sound location and types throughout a patient’s breathing pattern.- Clinical-based tests for the use of a multi lead sound auscultation unit.;

To study infection or develop therapeutics, some researchers use immortalised or cancerous epithelial cell lines, but these do not contain the diversity of cells within the respiratory epithelium and are poorly suited infection models. Superior human infection models that contain differentiated primary epithelial cells is fundamental to discovering effective therapeutics and generating robust data to move forward to pre-clinical trial.Why us?:We have a resource of paediatric and adult human airway tissue (Living Airway Biobank) with over 270 primary epithelial cell samples from consenting donors and ethical approval to collect more (Ref: 19/NW/0171). We also have a team of cell culture experts who can prepare differentiated primary cultures from paediatric, adult, and geriatric donors.Our collaborative pipeline:The team at GOS ICH have established a research infrastructure to support research linked to detecting, assessing, and combatting newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The collaborators have developed a collaborative SARS-CoV2 pipeline of detection and surveillance (through virus sequencing and surveillance (Breuer)), functional readouts of viral pathogenicity (Smith, O’Callaghan) and COVID19 drug pharmacokinetic evaluation (Standing).If of interest, please contact UCL's Head of European Research and Innovation, Kimberly Cornfield (k.cornfield@ucl.ac.uk).;

It is affecting 1% of the population above 60.The share of the Taiwanese population above 60 is already 20% and increasing, so it is a major health care issue for the society. PD is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, and patients gradually lose their motor functions and ability to take care of themselves before dying from the disease. In this project we focus on the motor symptoms, mainly tremor, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia, which significantly cause impairment in the quality of life of patients and disability in daily activities. The most common assessment tool for PD–the Unified Parkinson’s DiseaseRating Scale–is only suitable for clinical usage and provide a rather subjective score. Our aim is to automate and improve the quantification of the motor symptoms, first for clinical evaluation and later for self evaluation using a smart phone. We will develop a computer vision system for video based quantification of motor symptoms that utilizes deep learning and convolutional neural networks. We believe that this could reduce the anxiety and improve the quality of life of patients with Parkinson’s disease. We have already established an experimental protocol and recorded data from more than 20 subjects at the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital. We are now seeking collaborators to expand our data collection and address the variability in UPDRS scores and apply for future EU funding. The goal is to assist PD patients to maintain control over their life and reduce the growing health care burden.;

Nichoids are an advanced 3Dculture substrate used as a synthetic niche for cells, that well mimics the parenchyma structure remaining inert and transparent and visible through in-life time-lapse microscopy. Nichoids are used to co-culture the constitutively Thy1-YFP-16 brainbow hippocampal neurons, hippocampal astrocytes and CX3CR1-GFP adult microglia cells. This 3D cell in vitro co-culture system will allow us to imitate and understand the complex relationships between these three different cell types, all constitutively fluorescent, enabling the visualization of in-life cellular-cellular interactions. We aim at studying cellular and molecular interactions among neurons, astrocytes and microglia to understand the critical role that synapses play in the normal neurophysiology and their dysfunction/loss in pathological conditions. In particular, we designed and set up the 3D “quadripartite synapse” in vitro model to study synapse function/dysfunction and to identify:1- key interactions/interactors among cell types: neurons-astrocytes-microglia cells;2- the stress intracellular signaling pathways regulating synapse function/dysfunction, both in control and stress conditions, in order to mimic synaptic toxicity in brain diseases.This 3D project stands on the following key-concepts:Key concept 1: Neurological disorders still represent one of the highest burden for society, but no cures are available yet.Key concept 2: Synaptic dysfunction is an early and common event in many neurological, neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders and represents an important therapeutic window.Key concept 3: It is urgent to find an adequate model to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating synaptic dysfunction.For more information, you can contact Prof. Tiziana Borsello (tiziana.borsello@unimi.it).";

Entropy is used as a tool for diagnosing disease, but it appears that entropy has never been identified as a target that could play a role in the prevention and/or cure of disease.Prevention can be achieved by avoiding longevity in the highly entropic states such as fear (anxiety) and grief (depression) and enriching the state with high potential, tranquility, the state of no fear and grief. More effective treatment can be achieved if a link is made between the therapy and the individual's lifestyle, which may enrich and pave the way for personalised therapy. It is expected that the harmony between therapy and patient will lead to a compatible system, which provides a highly ordered system with reduced entropy and high potential. The permissible drug, which is compatible with lifestyle, increases trust and reduces entropy, which is essential to activate the placebo effect and thus increase potential energy.The reduction of entropy creates favourable circumstances that act in synergy with the prescribed medication and promote healing towards recovery. This study aims to explore the concept of entropy in the context of the human body and provide more insight into the rationalization and implementation of the concept as an essential parameter for prevention and healing.Contact details: Jawad Alzeer;Department of Chemistry, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland;E-mail address: jawad.alzeer@chem.uzh.ch;Phone: 0441 44 635 42 56";

About the LBG;The Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft (LBG) is a research institution focusing on medicine, life sciences, humanities, social and cultural sciences and initiating new research topics of particular societal relevance in Austria. The LBG currently operates 19 Ludwig Boltzmann Institutes together with academic and applied partners and develops and tests new forms of cooperation between science and non-scientific actors such as companies, the public sector and civil society. 2. What we are looking for / what we can offer;The LBG would like to contribute its expertise in a variety of scientific areas related to the EU COVID call, in particular topics “SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020-2C – Behavioural, social and economic impacts of the outbreak response” and ”SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020-2D – Pan-European COVOD-19 Cohorts”. We are looking to join a consortium as work package leader or contributor, depending on the needs of the consortium. In the context of the call we can contribute the expertise of our currently running projects on mental health (section 3 below), the impact of COVID measures on vulnerable families (section 4) as well as psychosocial support for children and families (section 5). Additionally, the LBG is running several medical COVID projects (summarised in section 6). These LBG initiatives are described in detail below and can be (partially or in their entirety) upscaled as a work package in the context of the COVID call – or as individual tasks within work packages – depending on the needs and structure of the consortium. 3. Potential contribution on mental health: the “have your say” initiative;The corona pandemic and corresponding measures to contain the virus affect us all. That is why the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft has launched the initiative ""Tell us! What does Corona do with our mental health?"". Everyone can contribute observations on the effects of the Corona crisis on mental health to themselves and others on the online platform corona.lbg.ac.at. Contributions are possible until June 28th in the broad thematic focus areas “Education and Learning”, “Work and Occupation” and “Social Isolation and Loneliness”. These contributions from crowdsourcing flow directly into a series of co-creation workshops and serve as a basis for an interdisciplinary team of experts and practitioners to develop recommendations for action for politics as well as new research questions.For detailed information on that Open Innovation in Science initiative of LBG in relation to the impact of the current Corona virus crisis on the mental health in several societal areas and among several (vulnerable) societal groups see: https://corona.lbg.ac.at/; 4. Vulnerable families: COVID as part of our Village project;Responding to COVID-19 measures and enhancing reach for particularly vulnerable families has been integrated into the already running “Village” project to respond to family isolation and strengthen support for children living with a parent with a mental illness.Through open innovation in science methods, we will co-design training and online activities which will foster engagement and trust building between Village Facilitators, parents, and children involved in the project. This initiative is a direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic and measures put in place in Tyrol since the 15th of March 2020.Online activities will be co-designed and will include: (1) an online training suite for practitioners, and (2) tools and activities to support family and child engagement to understand the everyday life of the child and enhance their social support. Specifically, the focus of this OIS initiative will be the topic of supporting engagement and trust-building.5. Psychosocial support measures for children and families: DOT;In this cooperation project, the opportunities and challenges of the psychosocial care system in its upheaval due to the Corona crisis are being researched. together with the Austrian League for Child and Adolescent Health.Important learning experiences in terms of social solidarity and digitization are currently taking place within psychosocial care services for children, adolescents and families, which will influence future psychosocial care. These changes are relevant for the research group in order to optimize the (digital) offer developed by DOT for crises and exceptional situations.The results of the study will include well-founded, practically relevant and feasible proposals for dealing with challenges arising from the crisis and for dealing with future social crises in the sense of maintaining social ties. They also inform about the optimization of the digital offerings of the research group DOT for such crises. This project focuses on cooperation with network partners from the psychosocial care sector and their needs in practical work.6.

The disease can progress into overt pneumonia, critical uncontrolled lung inflammation and death. There is no cure and the problem is acute as of February 2020 in the EU. The idea of convalescent blood derived products for treatment of infection is not new, but mostly restricted to intravenous (parenteral) ad-ministration. There is no evidence that the new SARS-Cov2 virus circulates systemically and it is un-likely that convalescent immunoglobulin will be successfully delivered to lung and respiratory tract epithelium. In addition, a well-conducted clinical trial using parenteral convalescent plasma in Ebola patients was not successful (Van Griensven et al, NEJM 2016). The delivery of passive immunity through nasal delivery from a simple nasal pharmacy spray to people at risk of infection de-serves attention. Healthcare workers and elderly in retirement homes may be the primary population targeted. This has been tested before (read Weltzin & Monath, Clin Microbiol Rev, 1999) and conva-lescent serum is more effective in prophylaxis than it is in treatment (read Casadevall & Pirofski, J Clin Invest, 2020).IDEAL STUDY DESIGN:• Deliver convalescent serum nasal spray to consenting disease-free nurses & doctors;• Deliver control non-convalescent serum nasal spray to consenting disease-free nurses & doc-tors;o Ask participants to use nasal spray entirely (dose?) in the course of a working day (8 hours);o Ask them to deeply inhale every shot.• Follow-up 14 days after delivery:o primary endpoint is infection with SARS-COV2 with symptoms;o Secondary endpoint is SARS-COV2 infection at 28 days after delivery;PRODUCTION OF CONVALESCENT SERUM:• Several renown EU blood institutions (Sanquin, NHSBT, German Red Cross, EFS, …) can do this; • In summary:o Call in patient-donors for plasmapheresis; Should fulfill standard blood donation criteria; Should have had disease onset 24-32 days ago; Should be free of symptoms since at least 10 days; Should be negative for SARS-COV2; Should be formerly confirmed SARS-COV2 positive by lab testing;• Plasma product should be tested for SARS-COV2;o When positive, product should be discarded;o When negative, proceed to use;• Plasma product should be tested for immunoglobulins reactive against SARS-COV2. A recent paper by the Hong-Kong Shenzen Hospital indicated in 16 recovered patients that 100% of them had IgG against the SARS-COV2 RBD region (https://dgalerts.docguide.com/...)• Ideally:o deliver plasma or serum to pharma-production company;• Pharma-production company should fill vials of nasal spray in a sterile manner, product is assumed to be stable and sterile for at least 30 days when stored frozen.• Start clinical trial at one hospital, have clinical trial performed by experienced trialists.";https://crowdhelix.com/uploads/post_attachments/5e7e3170a28a3_2020%2003%2020%20COVID%20profylaxis.docx

These methodologies should be adapted for the needs of conformity assessment and for continuous clinical evaluation throughout the lifetime of the device. Proposals should take into account the various specificities of high-risk medical devices and therapeutic areas if relevant.”What we mainly have ideas about is the collection of data after the introduction of a medical device on the market, the so-called post market surveillance. A lot of data is collected in a hospital that may be of value to medical device manufacturers. Think of failure data, incidents, complications or calamities. However, this data collection does not take place in a structured manner and often contains confidential information, resulting in this information not normally being shared with the manufacturer. However, it contains a lot of valuable information that could improve safety and, in particular, reduce user errors. We have all kinds of ideas about this (see attached concept document), but realise that so far we had little time to concretise this.;https://crowdhelix.com/uploads/post_attachments/5dfa46ece95bc_20160122_optimising%20quality%20cycle%20v1%20-%20clean.pdf

In the first step, the pancreatic cells come from islets harvested from donors. In this project, they will replace the pancreatic islets by stem cells transformed into alpha and beta cells. With this approach, the patient does not have to wait for donor cells as it uses pluripotent stem cells from patients’ own tissues (which do not require an intervention on the patient’s pancreas and can be harvested from blood and fat tissue spaces with minimally invasive procedures). Therefore, they aim to modify human stem cells with commercially available lentiviral-based CRISPR/Cas tools to inhibit expression of relevant genes (B2M and CIITA) which will lead to disruption of the antigen system of the potential patient (HLAs). As a result, we should obtain a recombined stable human stem cell line suitable for directed differentiation into α and β cells and further bo-printing and transplantation.Specifically, the consortium is looking for partners who:(1) have expertise in stem cell isolation from human tissues and propagation;(2) work on CRISPR/CAS9 genetic changes in stem cells;(3)have ability of transformation of stem cells into insulin and glucagon producing cells.";

We propose to develop a use-ready database of curated audio and text testimony of the experience of the impact of a range of infectious diseases for use in contexts of vaccine uptake hesitancy. This resource represents an innovative contribution to fresh, creative and public-facing ways of addressing this societal challenge.The decline in family/community memory of the experience of common communicable infectious diseases is a contributing factor in the reduction in vaccine uptake. Testimony, memories and stories from the generations who experienced such diseases prior to the introduction of immunisation programmes are a significant yet underexploited resource in the public discourse around vaccine hesitancy. Due to the aging demographic associated with this group of individuals, the experiential and community memory of these diseases will soon fade, and it is imperative to gather these narratives before they are lost. Their value is inestimable in terms of public health promotion, and their use will serve to raise public awareness of the significant consequences of such diseases. We propose to carry out an oral history project that collects and preserves these narratives, and to develop a use-ready text and audio database of narratives, contextualised with regard to both social history and infection/immunity. This database willbe trialled for use by healthcare professionals, health education providers and public health authorities.University College, Cork, offers an on-site multidisciplinary team from the humanities and health sciences, led by the Cork Folklore Project, an oral history archive and collection unit with 23 years of experience (www.ucc.ie/research/cfp). The CFP is a leading engaged research and oral history centre, and serves as a model of collection, archiving and dissemination practice in cultural heritage and social engagement contexts. Recent research projects with the Health Services Executive has seen us develop our engagement with the targeted use of oral history in health care and social inclusion contexts.

This has resulted in a body of work studying the molecular basis of T lymphocyte-blood endothelial cell recognition which directs lymphocyte trafficking to organised lymphoid tissues and sites of infection and immunity. A major focus has been the regulation of L-selectin expression on T lymphocytes and its impact on physiological and pathological T cell trafficking via specialised high endothelial venule (HEV) blood vessels. Recent studies have revealed an essential role for L-selectin in the recruitment of killer T cells into flu-infected lungs for virus clearance (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-w...).Current studies are exploring pharmacological and genetic approaches to boost L-selectin expression on T lymphocytes to help killer T cells find and destroy viruses.

362;Seeking to join international consortium for the upcoming Coordinating and supporting research on the human microbiome in Europe and beyond;https://crowdhelix.com/opportunities/seeking-to-join-international-consortium-for-the-upcoming-coordinating-and-supporting-research-on-the-human-microbiome-in-europe-and-beyond-752;Shirly Rakier;Technion – Israel Institute of Technology;;Health;Consortium Partner;Personalised medicine, Human microbiome, Protein aggregation, Neurodegenerative diseases, Immunity, Amyloid, Microbial infection, Data comparability;Prof. Meytal Landau's microbial functional amyloids lab is fascinated about the structural and functional diversity of microbial functional amyloids. Amyloids are proteins that self-assemble into highly ordered fibrils that are mostly known for their involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, yet numerous amyloids are functional and participate in dedicated physiological activities, for example as virulence determinants in microbes, thereby serving as important drug targets.The remarkable variety of microbial species of the human microbiome generates significant quantities of secreted amyloids, for example by E. coli and Streptococcus mutans, which were found in the gastrointestinal tract and the oral cavity of humans, respectively. Microbial amyloids interact with the amyloids of host systems, putatively providing some immune-evasive and survival strategies, and were suggested to contribute to the pathology of aggregation diseases. Current research put forward the hypothesis that inter-species amyloid interactome has physiological and pathological significance, linking different amyloid diseases to microbial infections and even to individual microbiomes.The molecular and structural investigations on amyloids were thus far focused on human amyloids, which are associated with fatal human aggregation diseases. Our lab had pioneered the study of structure-function relationships in bacterial functional amyloids at the atomic level, and published the first structure of an amyloid fibril from bacteria. This structure, of the phenol soluble modulin α3 (PSMα3) peptide secreted by the pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus revealed a novel amyloid architecture of cross-α fibrils, which were toxic to human immune cells (Tayeb-Fligelman et. al., Science 2017). A truncated PSMα3, which revealed atypical β-rich fibril architecture, showed antibacterial activity (Salinas et. al., Nature Communications 2018). Other members of the PSM family, PSMα1 and PSMα4, involved in biofilm structuring, formed cross-β amyloid fibrils similar to athological amyloids, demonstrating that this architecture is conserved from bacteria to human (Salinas et. al., Nature Communications 2018). In microbes, these structures confer high stability to the biofilm matrix, leading to resistant infections. Overall, our investigations of the PSM family in S. aureus indicates structural plasticity of their fibrils being at the basis of their functional diversity (Landau, Nature Chemical Biology 2018). In addition, by showing structure similarity between human pathological amyloids and a biofilm-associated amyloid from enterobacteria, we offered repurposing of anti-Alzheimer’s compounds as anti-biofilm Agents (Perov et al., PLoS Pathogens in press). These interesting, yet frightening findings, suggested that microbial amyloids could induce amyloid aggregation diseases via cross-seeding. This is reminiscent of transmissible prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (known as the Mad Cow disease).The studies of probiotic and pathogenic microbial amyloid systems being conducted at our lab are crucial for understanding the basis of their diverse roles in infections and pave the way for the design of novel antivirulence drugs that will address bacterial resistance and perhaps neurodegeneration and systemic amyloid diseases.In this microbiome project, we wish to apply our structural expertise for deciphering how microbial amyloid transmission from the gut to internal organs and the brain can affect human protein aggregation diseases.;"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/sc1-hco-17-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=SC1-HCO-17-2020;typeCodes=0,1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502;programCode=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=Default;sortQuery=openingDate;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState"

The main project area of interest now is in perinatal mental health and birth-related trauma (in particular Traumatic stress and PTSD).The main challenge:The WHO intrapartum guideline for a positive birth experience has emphasised the importance of maternal emotional and psychological wellbeing during childbirth, as well as the need for safe births. There is evidence that approximately 30% or 1.5 million women across Europe experience childbirth as negative or traumatic.Recent research has highlighted the importance of the birth environment, and studies looking at why women experience birth as traumatic have found that patient-provider interactions may also play a role, and communications about interventions may be more important than the interventions themselves. This is important because the birth environment and the interactions therein are modifiable to improve women’s experience. Therefore, if the effect of interactions with the maternity team is better understood, and communication between women and caregivers can be influenced positively, there is a real opportunity to prevent/reduce negative and traumatic birth-related experiences, optimising outcomes for women, infants and families. More recently, the impact of shortcomings in patient-provider interactions is being reported as a source or stress/distress to clinicians. The impact of traumatic stress in maternity staff and its link with women’s negative/traumatic experience of birth must be considered, as it also has the potential to be mitigated. Childbirth does not occur in a vacuum, and the experience is highly influenced by social norms and culture, whilst simultaneously situated within local organisational systems and structures.We are interested in a number of ways to tackle the problem through:- Optimising the birth environment to reduce/prevent negative/traumatic birth experiences- Understanding how culture, organisational structures and regional differences in service provision influence childbirth experiences;- Short and long-term impacts on women, infants, and family relationships;- Deepening our understanding of the intergenerational transmission of trauma through biomedical and epigenetic research.- Health Economic Analysis of the impact of birth-related trauma (psychological outcomes) and PTSD in childbirth on healthcare consumption, and individual preferences about future reproductive choices and obstetric care.Brief Bio:Joan Lalor is a Professor in Midwifery in Trinity College Dublin. Joan was awarded a BNS (Hons), MSc, MA, PGDip in Clinical Health Science Education (Distinction) and PG Dip in Statistics (Distinction) and a PhD from Trinity College.

However, as a member of the academy Joan is also centrally involved in a number of collaborative interdisciplinary projects across Health, Education and the Humanities. Joan's methodological expertise lies within the application of qualitative methodologies (specifically Grounded Theory and Case Study) to complex issues in health care, Joan has a particular interest in area of sensitive research and ethical challenges in fieldwork. Joan completed her PhD studies "" A Longitudinal study of women's experiences of carrying an baby with a fetal abnormality up to the birth and beyond"". Her work in the area of prenatal diagnosis and perinatal palliative care continues. She is an expert member of the Implementation of Bereavement Guidelines in Maternity Care and the Neonatal Palliative Care Clinical Programmes, seeking to inform policy and service planning nationally.

G8 principles on research data:(a) Secure and agile data and distributed computing e-infrastructures: fostering the integration of a secure, permanent, on-demand service-driven, privacy-compliant and sustainable e-infrastructure incorporating distributed databases, computing resources and software.The European data and computing e-infrastructure landscape remains very fragmented which is an obstacle for research collaboration at European and global levels and introduces additional complexity for achieving sustainable governance. The challenge is to integrate at European level the geographically and disciplinary dispersed resources to achieve economies of scale and efficiency gains in providing the best data and computing capacity and services to the research and education communities. This action is interrelated to INFRADEV-04-2016, “European Open Science Cloud for Research”.(b) Access and preservation platforms for scientific information: supporting the integration and consolidation of e-infrastructure for reliable and permanent open access to digital scientific records, based on existing initiatives across Europe (institutional and thematic repositories, aggregators, etc.).The European infrastructures need to respond to the emerging requirements for seamless and reliable access to publications, research data and software. These requirements are complemented by the need for long term preservation and curation of scientific information to fully support data and computing intensive science. The challenge is to support the integration at European level of a robust and sustainable e-infrastructure, based on existing initiatives across Europe (institutional and thematic publishing platforms, aggregators, etc.) and services supporting European Open Access policies. An additional challenge is the building of capacity to link all kinds of digital research objects in order to enable a more transparent evaluation of research and reproducibility of results, enabling trust and facilitating access by innovative business actors.";https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation_en

The team works closely with colleagues in MH Intelligence Network to make available and to provide: data and intelligence to inform local areas; guidance on creating action plans; training on guidance; and measuring impact on local areas’ progress.Prevention Concordat: Public Health England is working with partners to develop a Prevention Concordat Programme for Better Mental Health. The programme aims to galvanise local and national action around the prevention of mental illness and promotion of good mental health; and facilitate every local area to put in place effective prevention planning arrangements by the end of 2017. Local plans, led by health and wellbeing boards, local authorities and Clinical Commissioning Groups, will enable every area to use the best data available to plan and commission the right mix of provision to meet local needs.In the first year of the programme, PHE are creating a suite of Prevention Concordat resources to support local areas. These include a rapid review of evidence of what works which was published in July 2016 by the Mental Health Foundation[i], and tools for mental health joint strategic needs assessments, calculating return on investment and training local mental health champions. In addition, local prevention planning guidance has been developed, informed by stakeholder events which included local authorities, Clinical Commissioning Groups (NHS purchasers), experts by experience, members of the police, fire, and rail services, charities, national bodies, and providers.With the creation of the Prevention Concordat, Public Health England could contribute to the following areas under Expected Impact:- Advance prevention strategies and implementation of mental health interventions, alleviating global burden of mental disorders;- Improve tailored prevention and treatment;- Reduce health inequalities and inequities;- Maximise the use of existing relevant programmes ( eg. research, data, and delivery platforms);- Contribute to UN SDGs;Contact:Jacy McGaw-Cesaire Jacy.McGaw-Cesaire@phe.gov.uk;& Cecilia Buffery cecilia.buffery@phe.gov.uk;Tel: +44 (0) 1980 612 186 Mob: +44 (0) 7789 693472";https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation_en

For the detection part – the gold nanoparticles will be used as contrast agents. We recently introduced a new method for cancer detection from the skin surface, based on diffusion reflection (DR) measurement of gold nanoparticles bioconjugated to anti–epidermal growth factor receptor.For the therapy part – the gold nanoparticles will be used as radiosensitizers. We have recently developed personalized molecular profiling for the enhancement of radiation therapy using targeted GNP-radiosensitizers. In our study we evaluated the role of personalized molecular profile as a tool for radiation enhancement through its capability to target GNP to tumors.

By studying key protein-protein interactions and the structure-dynamic-function relationships, we can design CARGO peptides able to displace target interactions and thus produce therapeutic molecules. In summary our expertise are:• Investigation of the intracellular signaling pathways that transmit and integrate stress signals;• Identification of key protein involved in pathological pathways;• Identification of relevant interaction domain of key protein;• Pharmacological manipulation signalling pathways key protein using cell-permeable peptides (CPPs).Concerning the synaptic dysfunction, which characterizes early phases of both RTT and AS, we suppose that therapeutic intervention to protect synapses has great potential to tackle rare diseases.Our expertise is centered on evaluation of synaptopathy, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment using both in vivo and in vitro approaches:- In vivo: Behavioural studies, which will allow us to assess the cognitive functionality are coupled with biochemical and morphological studies for the analysis of dendritic spines dysfunction/dysmorphogenesis. Synapse dysfunction can be Biochemically assessed as previously published (Gardoni et al., 1998) by Western blotting on Triton Soluble Fraction (TIF) and on purified synaptosomes. While concerning dysmorphogenesis to obtain the adequate spine-resolution, Electron Microscopy is used to investigate spine morphology in tissue serial sections. (see Sclip et al., 2014). The number of spines as well as changes in PSD surface volume and length will are quantified by collecting digital serial electron micrographs and performing 3D structure reconstructed with Neurolucida software.- In vitro: Synapse dysfunction will be biochemically assessed as previously published (Gardoni et al., 1998) by Western blotting on Triton Soluble Fraction (TIF) to study post-synaptic elements while the pre-sinaptic element will be visualized on purified synaptosomes. By using neurons from brainbow transgenic mice, that facilitate the analysis of dendritic spines number and morphology, we perform time-lapse analyses (up to 24hrs) to assess the synaptic dysfunction and/or their plasticity (Sclip et al., 2013).For more information you can contact Prof. Tiziana Borsello (tiziana.borsello@unimi.it ).";

Our scientific interest is to understand signalling pathways involved in synaptopathy as well as in neuronal death, with the challenge to define key proteins in these neurodegenerative events. Our final aim is to design and to test specific bioactive cargoes, which inhibit key proteins action and allow to obtain neuroprotection.Our expertise is to correlate cognitive impairment to synaptic dysfunction; in order to do that we use different approaches:• Behavioural studies, which will allow us to assess the cognitive functionality as well as biochemical and morphological studies, which correlates with dendritic spines dysfunction/dysmorphogenesis and impaired behaviour.• In vitro: by using of neurons from brainbow transgenic mice, that facilitate the analysis of dendritic spines number and morphology, we are able to perform time-lapse analyses (up to 24hrs) to assess synaptic dysfunction and/or spines plasticity (Sclip et al., 2013).• In vivo: to obtain the adequate spine-resolution, Electron Microscopy is used to investigate spine morphology in serial sections of brain tissue (see Sclip et al., 2014).

The constructs will be evaluated “in vitro” for the correct expression of the inserted transgenes by Western blot and immunfluorescence and then applied to mice for safety and immunogenicity. The main advantage of the genetic and avipox vectors is their intrinsic safety due to their inability to replicate although capable to express the foreign genes in mammals.For more information you can contact me (Dr. Alice Barbaglio, Research Services Division; (officina.h2020@unimi.it) and I will bring you into contact with UMIL research group.";
