49793;0656/2015;mBITion (mobile, ambition to reach low literacy and BIT;Bourek Aleš, MUDr. Ph.D.;1062;Partner;LF;Biofyzikální ústav;"Main aim of the proposed project is to support self-management of healthy behavior of vulnerable populations (ageing and low SES) across the EU using evidence-based Behavioral Intervention Technologies (BITs)  in mHealth applications. This will contribute to the quality and economic sustainability of prevention, cure and care. These BITs offer the advantage that they can effectively provide personal and dynamic support , by using a combination of mathematical, dynamic modelling of behavior and behavior change intervention techniques, and effectively combining different sources of information. The extent to which BITs provide advantages, however, highly depends on the content delivered, and the fit with an individual. 
As such we have operationalized the following project objectives: 
1.	To identify empirically validated (personal and social/physical) behavior change mechanisms and behavior change techniques that can effectively motivate and support people to self-manage their health.
2.	To identify potentially effective BITs and to evaluate their content, mode of delivery and user experiences on the fit with vulnerable groups.
3.	To design and build dynamically tailored BITs based on objectives 1 and 2, in co-creation with stakeholders (including end-users) for two specific cases.
4.	To design and build a scalable platform for gathering of necessary data and delivery of services and BITs over a range of available ICT infrastructure, depending on the personal situation
5.	To validate  the BITs within their specific context, focusing on effectiveness, user experience and implementation fidelity in relation with vulnerable/low literacy groups, as specific requirements need to be met in order to fit with the demands and needs of these groups
6.	To develop business models in relation to the proposed solution that fit multi stakeholder interests and allow for scaling up to reach all vulnerable people in the EU"
46903;0037/2015;Abnormal accumulation of glucose-derived metabolite, methylglyoxal, or “dicarbonyl stress” as a common mechanism of metabolic and vascular co-morbidities in obesity, diabetes and renal failure;Kaňková Kateřina, prof. MUDr. Ph.D.;2524;Příjemce;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;"Obesity, diabetes and kidney failure are common co-morbidities leading to impaired glucose control and increased risk of vascular disease. They are of high and increasing prevalence in EU countries. These co-morbidities are leading causes of further health decline and premature mortality, posing challenges for appropriate and effective healthcare and resources. Current treatments are unable to halt the disease epidemics and to prevent their late consequences. Identification and targeting new metabolic pathways and other metabolic abnormalities seem likely to yield improved therapy, particularly in a personalized approach. The aim of this project is to investigate how abnormal high levels of the reactive metabolite methylglyoxal (a principal marker of “dicarbonyl stress”) in obesity, diabetes and renal failure contributes to common mechanisms driving development of metabolic and vascular co-morbidities and exploit this for improved patient care. We will characterise the role of dicarbonyl stress in the co-morbidities and evaluate, at proof of concept stage, novel nutritional medicine treatments. The objectives are:
1. To develop experimental evidence in preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the pathophysiological role of dicarbonyl stress in metabolic and vascular co-morbidities of obesity, diabetes and renal insufficiency.
2. To personalize treatment and care by developing biomarkers to stratify the patient population by severity of dicarbonyl stress.
3. To evaluate treatments for dicarbonyl stress to halt and alleviate co-morbidities. The primary clinical intervention evaluated is a dietary bioactive formulation (nutritional medicine) that increases expression of glyoxalase 1 - the enzyme that detoxifies methylglyoxal.
4. To expand the skills base and share best practise in dicarbonyl stress research.
5. To secure related technical and medical innovation for the EU. 
The likely outcome will be novel diagnostic markers to facilitate personalized treatment of dicarbonyl stress and safe, nutritional medicine for alleviation of common co-morbidities."

Thus, finding ways to enhancing motor skill learning capacity in Parkinson's is essential. Past research indicates that sensory stimulation and task cueing can improve motor learning. Yet, the extent to which increasing individual's engagement in the task, in addition to sensory stimulation, can have further positive effects remains unknown. This innovation grant aims to demonstrate that increased task engagement through ecological goals and social interaction can significantly improve procedural learning capacity in people with Parkinson's. To this end, performance in a classical implicit motor learning paradigm (goal: reacting to stimuli presented on a computer screen) will be contrasted with that of two other conditions, where a console videogame (similar to Guitar Hero) will be used, with or without social interaction, in a controlled experiment involving people with Parkinson's and age and gender-matched controls. The ecological goals in the videogame conditions (playing a musical instrument alone or during social interaction) are expected to increase task engagement and improve motor learning capacity more than the classical paradigm. The project is innovative because it uses existing low-cost technology to evaluate the ecological contribution of motivation/reward in increasing motor skill learning capacity in Parkinson's. This research is a critical step in further expanding the range of low-cost, non-pharmacological interventions which can easily be implemented outside the clinical setting (i.e. at home) and tailored to one's needs/preferences, hence contributing to the advancement of personalized tele-interventions means in Parkinson's.
41054;0257/2014;Innovation of materials for teaching the basics of pharmacology;Máchalová Alena, MUDr. Ph.D.;59956;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Farmakologický ústav;Childhood cancers are rare diseases with an incidence of one per 100,000 people, compared to adult cancers. Although this type of disease is rare, it is the second most common cause of death in children after accidents. The treatment of these patients in the Czech Republic is centralised in two specialised centres: the Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology at Motol Hospital in Prague and the Department of Paediatric Oncology at Brno University Hospital. The treatment of haemato-oncology patients is also partly provided by centres in Ostrava, Olomouc, Plzeň, Hradec Králové, Plzeň, České Budějovice and Ústí nad Labem. In accordance with the recommendation of the Council of Europe (2009/C 151/02), the centres of the Motol Hospital and Brno Hospital have established and maintain a database of diagnosed and treated paediatric patients. The database contains over 6 thousand records of patients diagnosed since 1995. The data from the clinical database are currently used for internal clinical and scientific purposes, but their scope is limited to clinical events and treatment provided in one of the two main centres. To enter into international projects, linkage with other data sources and overall validation and standardisation of the available data is necessary. There is a lack of data on long-term survival, secondary comorbidities including secondary malignancies diagnosed in adulthood. Also, analysis to determine the true extent of the diseased population in the Czech Republic could not yet be carried out. This current deficit in data sources excludes the Czech Republic from international projects such as EUROCARE or ACCIS, to which all neighbouring countries actively contribute their data. The aim of the project is to solve this serious shortage by extracting all available data sources followed by a thorough statistical analysis and making the results available in the form of an information and educational portal.

RNDr. DrSc.;610;Příjemce-koordinátor;CEITEC;VS Jaroslava Koči;Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling system represents one of the major tools of cell communication. FGF signal via activation of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1-4) to regulate a variety of developmental and regenerative processes. Aberrant FGFR activation frequently leads to disease. Activating mutations in FGFR3 alone account for at least 10 conditions, including syndromes affecting skeletal development, skin and cancer. Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase represents a major mediator of the FGFR function, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown.

These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, interactions of FGFRs with the protein members of their signaling complexes, processes governing active FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR-ERK signal. Through a combination of mathematical modelling, genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry approaches, we will describe, for the first time, the regulatory networks mediating prolonged activation of ERK pathway, in major biological processes regulated by FGFRs. These will include pathological FGFR signaling in skeletal dysplasias and cancer, and physiological FGFR signaling in maintenance of pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC).

Pathological synapse development and/or function result in many neuropsychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation, and Alzheimer's disease. It is of fundamental and clinical importance to understand the biochemical, cellular and molecular biological basis of synaptic function and plasticity. The functional synapses heavily depend upon healthy postsynaptic density (PSD), which is a cytoskeletal organization close to the postsynaptic membrane. SHANK3 is a key element of the PSD. Dysregulation of SHANK3 leads to pathophenotypes of synapses, which is linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, especially autism.

The DDR network of checkpoint and repair pathways counterbalances the potentially mutagenic effects of endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging assaults, thereby avoiding and/or delaying the onset of life-threatening diseases, neurodegenerative and immunological disorders, premature aging or cancer. Despite the recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of the DDR, many mechanistic aspects, including genes and pathways of DNA damage recognition, replication fork maintenance and re-start, damage signaling, checkpoint control, DNA repair, or chromatin modulation remain to be discovered and/or characterized. In this proposal, six laboratories with complementary multidisciplinary expertise join forces to improve our current knowledge in this area of biomedicine. In particular, we hypothesize that an omnipotent threat to genomic integrity in all proliferating cells may represent the major source of genomic instability that leads to cancer or other diseases. We aim to: 1) characterize the role of selected nucleases/glycosylases in DDR pathways with main focus on their regulation and redundancy. In particular, we will focus on protein-mediated interactions and post-translational modification by SUMOylation; 2) optimize hits identified in the pilot experiments with the aim to identify novel organic compounds with targeted biological activity that would be superior to known inhibitors; 3) identify genetic backgrounds that confer sensitivity (SSL phenotype) to a simultaneous inhibition of activity of selected key genome stability-associated genes, which may be potentially exploitable in the clinic."

The work described is based on published and significant unpublished data and will be made possible by the complementary expertise in the Masarik and Saatcioglu laboratories. STAMP2 was cloned in the Saatcioglu laboratory some years ago and its androgen regulation and expression profile in human PCa specimens suggested that it can have a role in PCa. We now dissect the signaling pathways that STAMP2 is involved in to promote PCa proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis, in particular related to the metabolic pathways involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). Whereas Saatcioglu laboratory has world leading expertise to study STAMP2 expression and function, Masarik laboratory is steeped in metabolic pathways and ROS in PCa. The combination of the two areas of expertise is expected to result in significant new knowledge. In addition, nanoparticle mediated STAMP2 targeting in preclinical mouse models of PCa have proven to be curative and will be further developed and optimized, thus potentially leading to proof-of-principle findings that may form the basis for translational applications.

They are very diverse molecules in terms of size, microbial targets, mode of action, release from producer cells, and immunity mechanisms of the producing strains. With an increasing need for alternatives for existing antibiotic therapies in the last decades, bacteriocins are one of the most hopeful alternatives to ""classical"" antibiotics. The main feature distinguishing colicins (i.e. bacteriocins produced by enterobacteria) from classical antibiotics is that colicins have a relatively narrow killing spectrum. This colicin specificity is caused by highly specific molecular interactions of a colicin molecule with components of a cell envelope of susceptible bacteria (receptor molecules). Since the molecular interactions responsible for colicin specificity are still not fully understood, this project focuses on the identification of epitopes that underlie the receptor specificity of selected colicin types with medical potential. For detailed characterization of these epitopes, an interdisciplinary approach comprising structural biology and molecular biology methods will be used. Based on the detailed understanding of specific colicin-bacterium interactions, we plan to construct novel colicin variants with directed antimicrobial specificity. Synthetic variants of colicins with modified activity spectra could be a starting point for new alternative or supplementary antibiotic therapies."

Traditionally, visual acuity has been measured by static high-contrast tests, conditions that are poorly suited to the real traffic situation. In this project we propose tests that simulate the movement of a client in space at a defined speed, and in this situation we evaluate dynamic visual acuity. The aim is to validate the applicability of these tests in practice and to evaluate the results in relation to traditional measurements.

PharmDr. Ph.D.;169493;Příjemce;LF;Farmakologický ústav;The aim of the project is to improve an innovative method of generating low-temperature plasma under atmospheric pressure, which is protected by a patent application, and to develop applications for the treatment of the internal surfaces of hollow products made of soft PVC used in the medical sector, mainly for blood bags and catheters. The primary purpose of these treatments will be to prevent the release of phthalate-based plasticizers into body fluids by crosslinking polymer macromolecules found in the surface nanolayer of the material. Phthalates compromise the function of internal organs and increase the risk of allergies and asthma. They can have a negative effect on blood clotting and the hormonal and reproductive systems, compromise the function of internal organs or increase the risk of allergies and asthma. A further objective of the project will be to increase the hydrophilicity of PVC surfaces and thereby reduce the deposition of particles from body fluids as well as microbial cell adhesion and the formation of bacterial biofilms.

With the knowledge of the genome and the introduction of new technologies, the concept of personalised medicine is mainly related to the possibility of tailoring the proposed pharmacotherapy to a specific individual on the basis of molecular genetic testing. A specific chapter within personalised pharmacotherapy is that of medicinal products (LPs) for modern therapies, which include gene or somatic cell therapy or tissue engineering products. With the development of this field of medicine, there is debate about the regulation of these approaches and the major ethical issues involved.

Pharmacologically very interesting groups of plant alkaloids are the benzophenanthridine alkaloids, which are mainly characterised by their anticancer effects, and cannabinoids, which can be used, for example, to treat depression and anxiety, neurodegenerative diseases and other serious brain diseases. Both these groups of alkaloids therefore provide very valuable inspiration for drug design and development.

This process involves the design of the drug structure using chemoinformatic methodologies, its synthesis and its laboratory testing (i.e., analysis of its interactions with target biomacromolecules, testing in cell and tissue culture, in vivo assays).  The possibility of creating an interdisciplinary project within MU and the involvement of research teams with high quality expertise in the required areas opens up space for us to respond to this challenge.

However, a small proportion of these tumours, contrary to the theoretical prognosis, metastasize early to the lymph nodes, which is the first step towards tumour delocalization. Currently, there is an urgent clinical need to find an appropriate diagnostic approach to select a group of patients at higher risk of metastasis and to indicate appropriate more aggressive therapy to reduce the risk of disease relapse. To this end, a clinicopathologically characterized cohort of 48 low-grade breast cancers will be analyzed using advanced systems biology approaches: transcriptome analysis by next-generation sequencing, SWATH proteomics, and digital pathology. Proteins on the tumor cell surface suitable as targets for biological therapy will also be sought. The obtained data will be subsequently analysed both unimodally (processing of one type of data) and multimodally. Linear and non-linear classifiers will be used to construct unimodal and multimodal predictive models. The models will be adapted for both 'screening' (i.e. high sensitivity) and 'diagnosis' (high sensitivity and specificity) and tested both independently and as part of a possible hierarchical decision system. For clinical practice, the model or system of models that proves to be the most suitable not only in terms of prediction accuracy but also in terms of ease of implementation will be selected. The project will be complemented by an initial characterisation of the selected markers in relation to optimal therapy.

MUDr. Ph.D.;2002;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;I. neurologická klinika;Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the developed world. In the vast majority, their manifestations include heart failure. Research on the process of mechanical heart failure at the cellular and molecular level can be observed and modeled already on individual cardiac cells. Cardiomyocytes can be obtained without interfering with cardiac tissue by differentiation from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Cardiac cells are thus grown and beating in a laboratory dish, just a small piece of donor skin. If the donor is a person with a hereditary heart disease, mechanical and electrical manifestations can be observed in the heart cells.

The surface modification can be done plasmochemically, by applying a special kind of low-temperature electric plasma to the surface. Functional chemical groups can be generated on the treated surfaces to provide the biocompatibility sought. Plasmochemical reactions are often combined with classical chemical reactions for higher efficiency. Another goal of this work is to adapt the substrate surface to promote the specialization, growth, maturation and mechanical function of iPS-cardiomyocytes.

At the single cell level, contractions can be described using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Molecular biology methods can be used to describe changes in the structural properties of cells and their metabolism. At the level of individual cardiomyocytes, we can thus monitor the mechanisms causing heart failure in the body and search for new drugs and therapeutic approaches for its treatment.
38363;0725/2013;Proteomic analysis of amyloidogenic precursors and screening for mutational states of hereditary amyloidosis in the Czech Republic;Potáčová Anna, Mgr. Ph.D.;44190;Příjemce;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;"The treatment of haemato-oncological diseases (HON), which is becoming increasingly effective, resulting in the cure of an increasing proportion of patients, is characterised by a number of side effects that impair the quality of life of patients. The most common side-effect is extreme fatigue and inefficiency, which usually accompanies the patient from the beginning of the disease, worsens during the course of therapy and often persists for years after successful completion. One of the main causes of this fatigue stems from reduced overall fitness (=deconditioning), which is usually due to a negative change in the ratio of active body mass to fat mass and a decrease in physical activity (PA). It appears that fatigue accompanying malignant disease is closely related to the overall activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), particularly vagal activity. Spectral analysis (SA) of heart rate variability (HRV) can non-invasively assess the functional status of the ANS. Regular exercise is known to both increase physical fitness and cause positive changes in the ANS, both in healthy and diseased subjects. Although there is undoubted evidence of the positive effect of PA on the overall course of many cancers, it is surprising that even in the context of specialist supportive care, PA is not recommended at all, and often patients are even discouraged outright. The application of PA in haemato-oncology patients, who constitute a specific subgroup of patients within oncology, is hampered by a significant impairment of the production of blood elements of the clotting disorder, as well as by a decrease in the performance of the immune system. To date, the focus of HON treatment has been exclusively on the administration of variously aggressive chemotherapy, and patients thus constitute a very heterogeneous population in terms of physical training opportunities. For this reason, informed prospective clinical interdisciplinary research is highly desirable to develop guidelines for prescribing a PA program that could be implemented into standard clinical practice. Although physical training is a very logical and seamless intervention on the surface, safely translating this idea into routine clinical practice is a very difficult task. Close collaboration between haemato-oncologists and specialists in both physiotherapy and physical education and sport is imperative. In addition to the development of training guidelines, the aim of the project is to directly influence the disease process, i.e. a form of supportive ""treatment through movement""."

MUDr. CSc.;1050;Příjemce;LF;Klinika komplexní onkologické péče;The distribution of plantar pressures during gait is closely related to changes in the foot arch, gait stereotype, postural stereotypes and is also influenced by lower limb injuries. Podobarometry, which allows analysis of the distribution of these pressures, can be a very accurate indicator of the above changes and thus of the effectiveness of medical therapy for lower limb injuries. The aim of the project is to create and experimentally verify a standard of plantar pressure distribution in healthy pediatric population, on the basis of which it will be possible to evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation and especially to predict the outcome of rehabilitation therapy in time. The basic skeleton of the experimental research will consist of a series of formrographic measurements. Through a control group of four hundred healthy children, a typology of children's gait will be performed and an interval standard of optimal distribution of plantar pressures during gait will be created. The interval norms will mainly reflect age and somatic parameters. The typology of the plantar stride will be based on the assessment of the time course of plantar pressures and forces applied during the stride. The next step of the research will then be to apply the scoring systems to the process of indicating the effectiveness of therapy in a 100-strong experimental cohort of children following lower limb injuries. The final step of the project will be an accurate and comprehensive description of the experimentally validated method of early prediction of rehabilitation therapy effectiveness in a planned monograph and publication of the key findings in an impacted journal.

PharmDr. Ph.D.;167123;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Farmakologický ústav;Physical activity in the body induces a number of acute and chronic changes at the level of skeletal muscle and the cardiovascular system, but the cellular and especially molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptive response are currently not well understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently identified RNA molecules that have been implicated as essential intracellular mediators of processes involved in adaptation to locomotor activity, including angiogenesis, inflammation, mitochondrial metabolism, contractile force generation in cardiac/skeletal muscle, and muscle hypertrophy. Although circulating miRNA (c-miRNA) molecules have been studied as biomarkers in a number of diseases, data defining the role of c-miRNAs under conditions of acute training load and long-term training in healthy subjects are lacking, and their correlation with microRNA levels in urine and saliva is unknown. This project is concerned with defining the expression profiles of specific miRNAs in different body fluids (serum/urine/saliva) in different types of training (aerobic endurance, explosive strength and hypertrophy training) and relates them to other adaptive processes related to training detectable during clinical examination of the individual, in particular fitness parameters. The present project uniquely combines the approaches of modern physiology, molecular epigenetics and sports science (exercise physiology) and its outputs will contribute to improve the understanding of the role of microRNAs in adaptation to exercise in healthy populations.

MUDr. Ph.D.;24063;Příjemce;LF;Farmakologický ústav;The proposed research is envisioned to yield new (and potentially patentable) small-molecule inhibitors of human endonuclease Mus81 that would be proprietary to MU. As discussed above, Mus81 should be a good target for pharmacological intervention, especially in the area of new anticancer therapies. It should be noted that no crystal structure of the enzyme is known. This, together with the fact that no small-molecule inhibitors of Mus81 have been reported yet, presents an excellent starting point for academic high-risk/high-gain project. We believe that proper medicinal chemistry optimization of the proprietary HTS hit (compound 1B) will lead to advanced leads that will be suitable for further preclinical (and possibly clinical) progression.

MUDr. Ph.D.;72138;Jiný účastník;LF;Klinika plastické a estet.chirurgie;The proposed interdisciplinary project brings together the latest findings from historical anthropology, archaeology and history, cancer research and contemporary clinical practice. The main goal of the project is to integrate the most modern advanced genomic methods used in contemporary oncological research into the study of human skeletal remains of extinct populations (from different historical periods - from prehistoric to modern times) in order to study cancer. This approach has not yet been applied in historical anthropology (paleopathology). The integration of these methods into paleooncology should allow accurate and unambiguous diagnosis of primary cancers through differential diagnosis or help narrow the interval of possible tumor types. For metastases, the introduction of these methods should help to identify the primary tumour site. The aim of this interdisciplinary research is to modify the methodology currently used in medical research and clinical practice to be applicable to fragmented and degraded historical DNA, so that this type of diagnosis can become a routine part of the palaeopathological study of cancer in historical populations.

MUDr. Ph.D.;19402;Příjemce;LF;Klinika komplexní onkologické péče;Rituals occur in every human society and they very frequently occur during times of uncertainty, anxiety, and stress. Similarly, many individuals are genetically predisposed to ritualized behavior and appear to engage in these behaviors in order to reduce stress. Yet the way in which ritualized behaviors may allay stress across individuals, and in different social contexts, remains unknown. Previous research in this area has suffered from 3 major shortcomings: 1) a reliance on self-report data that fails to recognize the complexity of rituals, 2) it ignores individual variance in physiological stress profiles, and 3) has suffered from a lack of interdicipinary collaboration. The proposed research directly addresses these shortcomings by developing a highly interdisciplinary team to run field experiments on naturally occurring rituals in Fiji, Slovakia, and Serbia, and controlled laboratory experiments to investigate how ritual behavior impacts a person's homonal stress levels. In both the laboratory and the field we will use cutting-edge technology to assess the effects of different types and aspects of ritual behavior on stress responses by measuring physiological responses (heart rate, galvanic skin response), salivary steroid hormones (cortisol/testosterone/estradiol) and brain natriuretic peptide levels. The proposed research therefore represents an innovative study of a significant aspect of human behavior at the hormonal, behavioral, and socio-cultural levels. The research has the potential to inform a longstanding topic interest in many disciplines, and will do so in such a way as to elucidate the connections between diverse behavioral forms and physiological stress levels.

Treatment of staphylococcal infections is complicated by the frequent occurrence of antibiotic-resistant strains. In particular, methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, which are prevalent in hospital settings, are a major public health problem worldwide. Bacteriophages can be used as alternative therapeutics for bacterial infections, especially antibiotic-resistant strains. Due to the lack of legislation related to the approval of phages as pharmaceuticals, there is no phage preparation available on the market in any of the European Union, the USA or other developed countries for the treatment of human bacterial infections.

We will complement the structural studies with analysis of phage gene expression at different stages of infection. Our results obtained by combining molecular biological, structural and clinical approaches will allow further development and formal approval of the use of this phage for the therapy of staphylococcal infections in humans.
38183;0675/2013;The use of innovative approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of chemoresistant prostate cancer.;Masařík Michal, prof. RNDr. Ph.D.;21142;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;Religious and/or secular rituals are present in all known societies (historical or present), yet their possible functions are still debated. This natural human activity carries formidable epistemic, metabolic and material costs without any apparent benefits and therefore yields an evolutionary puzzle which is exemplified especially in extreme rituals often involving enormous physiological costs, body mutilation, pain or sacrifice of precious resources. We encounter those in religious ceremonial practices as well as in military rituals or other types of initiative hazing. Given such costs, some evolutionary theorists argue that rituals must provide, or in the ancestral past must have provided, countervailing adaptive benefits. A long-standing tradition of social scientists has stressed the role of collective rituals in the building of social cohesion and in-group trust (connected, on the other hand, with increase of out-group hostility). However, these assumptions have been rarely empirically tested and we still lack physiological mechanisms mediating these effects. Moreover, any real progress in this topic has been so far obstructed by fragmentary approach of separate disciplines. We therefore propose a series of studies conducted on multiple levels of analysis (from hormonal level to intra-/inter-group dynamics level) to elucidate (i) possible effects of extreme rituals on social cohesion, and (ii) purported working mechanisms behind these effects. By creating a highly integrative interdisciplinary team of top-rated scholars using diverse methodologies (ethnographic, experimental, mathematical modelling, social network analysis), we plan to bring novel understanding of the societal functions of extreme rituals and significantly contribute to understanding of this type of human behaviour.

MVDr. CSc.;47170;Příjemce;LF;Ústav histologie a embryologie; In particular, modern clinical and experimental epileptology seeks to elucidate the phenomenon of drug resistance, which would open the way leading to new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The diagnostic procedure for pharmacoresistant epilepsy usually includes invasive testing with intracerebral EEG electrodes monitoring the electrophysiological activity of the brain. The innovative aim of this project is a nanotechnological modification of these electrodes, which will allow to detect the electrochemical correlate of electrophysiological activity at the same level of invasiveness.

Cerebral functional connectivity will be studied using specific MRI techniques and statistical analyses - we will focus on assessing changes in functional connectivity in selected resting brain networks (motor, attentional, visual and ""default mode"" networks), changes in hemodynamic response during performance of a cognitive-visual task, and detecting changes in gray matter volume using ""source-based"" morphometry. We will also study the integrity of brain pathways using diffusion measurements and tractography. Participants will be comprehensively examined at study entry and after 6 months of intervention in the case of the active group/no intervention in the case of the control group. In addition, the active group will be examined by brain MRI at an additional 3 months and fully at six months after the end of the intervention. Behavioral changes will be correlated with changes on brain MRI, and the duration of any intervention effect will be assessed."

The project aims to establish a modern interdisciplinary research on meditation based on active collaboration and mutual synergy of the participating departments leading to a more precise operationalization of meditation techniques for their use in practical human health research. Not only critical reflection on the concept of meditation, the inclusion of the influence of suggestion in their study, but also methodologically sophisticated and high-quality cardiology studies aimed at improving the quality of life of patients after MI, are still lacking in the existing research on meditation. These gaps are the main focus of the project.

In the second phase of the project, we will apply a selected element of the meditation technique with beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system to post-MI patients. Clinical cardiological examination, determination of the cortisol curve as an indicator of stress, a test to detect the presence of sleep apnea and a questionnaire focused on the quality of life of the individual will be used to capture the effect of the selected meditation technique for the patient. Patients will participate in a rehabilitation programme at the Internal Cardiology Clinic of the University Hospital Brno, which will integrate meditation breathing and visualisation techniques in order to monitor their long-term effect on cardiovascular function and subsequent improvement of the patient's life after MI. The evaluation of the effect of suggestion on the effectiveness of meditation techniques predicts a greater response to the implemented, meditation-inspired technique. The results of the project will lead to improvement and innovation in the rehabilitation of patients after MI and will enable their faster return to normal life. It will also verify the applicability of meditation techniques in cardiology practice through a controlled experiment.

The reading disorder, dyslexia, is the most common specific learning disability. It is a receptive disorder based on the inability to characterize letters and words and to decode written text. Because dyslexia is based on the patient's language abilities, treatment is guided by this etiology. Training consists of letter and word recognition and reading practice. Most treatment programmes are highly individualised and involve many specialists - psychologists, paediatricians, speech therapists, educators, ophthalmologists, optometrists. The role of parents is also very important, especially in controlling the exercises and motivation. Currently, there is no adequate statistical evidence of visual and behavioural optometry, so these techniques are not recommended in professional circles. Our aim is to apply some visual and behavioral therapy methods to selected individuals with specific learning disabilities in order to improve and eliminate the symptoms of specific learning disabilities. Individuals will be selected on the basis of recommendations from educational and psychological counselors. Testing of school skills will be carried out in cooperation with colleagues from the Institute of Inclusive Education at the PedF MU Brno.

The Institute of Experimental Biology of the Faculty of Science and the Institute of Histology and Embryology of the Faculty of Medicine need to analyse transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for their research to an extent not possible with available techniques. The aim of the project is to develop software tools to overcome these limitations and to push the possibilities of analysing TEM images further. The functionality and usability of the newly developed software tools will be validated and demonstrated on two different biological applications: (1) categorization of exosomes and microvesicles according to their types, with the motivation to find a correlation between exosome and microvesicle type in patients with cancer or degenerative disease (2) monitoring changes in endoplasmic reticulum morphology, the assessment of which should be predictive of the physiological fitness of different cell populations. The project will not only result in software tools and new algorithms for the analysis of TEM images, but we also expect important biological conclusions to be possible thanks to new informatics approaches.

MUDr. Ph.D., MBA;24005;Partner;LF;Neurochirurgická klinika;Healthy population is a cornerstone of an economically, socially and humanly successful society (according to National priority of oriented research, experimental development and innovations). In relation to the current development of society and the growing interconnection of the world (increased travel and trade, demographic changes, human risk behaviour) there is an increasing need to monitor the origin of diseases and health problems in the population and to study ecological, environmental and socio-economic factors, which determine changes in the occurrence of infectious diseases. Aim of the proposed project is to conduct multidisciplinary research in studying eco-epidemiological, environmental and socio-economic factors driving emergence of infectious diseases. The spread and emergence of microbial diseases will be studied in terms of strengthening system of surveillance and preparedness for unexpected epidemiological situations. Project will involve detection/isolation and identification of a broad spectrum of emerging microbial pathogens including discovery of potential novel pathogenic candidates or new pathogenic variants of known microorganisms. Study will include serosurveys of free-living animals (reservoirs of diseases) as well as selected human risk groups for antibodies against infectious agents. From socio-economic point of view, two general population surveys and an outpatient survey will be integral part of the study with aim to measure the incidence and prevalence of selected infectious diseases and their risk factors. Data obtained will serve in eco-epidemiologic studies (risk assessment, new trends in emerging infections, future outbreak scenarios or molecular epidemiology). Experts from different fields of science: ecology, microbiology, veterinary and human medicine and sociology will contribute to surveillance, control and prevention of emerging infectious diseases in the Czech Republic. Finally, project will provide necessary information background for prevention of infectious diseases in contemporary society, determination of risk factors for acquiring infection, and for the public administration when preparing and implementing health policies at the national level.

MUDr. Ph.D.;1100;Partner;LF;Mikrobiologický ústav;Stem cells represent a category of cells with unique properties that predispose them to many applications in biomedical research and clinical medicine. However, all applications of all types of stem cells, embryonic, induced pluripotent and organ-derived, are deeply dependent on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence stem cell behavior, our ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into functional somatic cell types, or our ability to construct three-dimensional structures from stem and progenitor cells. The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the genetic instability of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, Protocols for differentiation of hES cells into lung epithelial lineages and neural crest cells will be further developed, the effects of biomimetic ligands on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, and microfluidic approaches and systems to test the biological properties of stem cells will be developed. The main experimental approaches will be in vitro manipulation of cells, imaging of live and fixed cells by advanced microscopy techniques, and molecular phenotyping of cell populations by quantification of relevant mRNAs and proteins.

Not only have the imaging methods used in navigation - ultrasound, scans, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging - been improved, but also endovascular or intratumoral treatment techniques have been developed in parallel. Currently, we are able to apply locoregional chemotherapy, perform chemoembolization with drug eluting beads.  With puncture techniques we are able to perform RFA, MW ablation, irreversible electroporation. By combining methods of local tumor destruction and targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, the antitumor effect can be multiplied due to synergy.

It continues and further develops the project MUNI/A/0964/2012. The outcome of the project is the analysis of safety and effectiveness of innovative procedures in paediatric oncology, especially the so-called personalised medicine. This therapeutic approach emphasizes the systematic use of knowledge about the cancer and the individual to select and optimize therapy. Currently, in paediatric oncology, we are faced with the reality that dozens and in the near future hundreds of anti-cancer agents are available whose mechanism of action is biological, i.e. they target a specific therapeutic target. However, the role in the treatment of children with cancer is not yet clearly defined and the benefit has yet to be established in most cases. In this project, we will analyse the use of personalised treatments at our institution. Clinical indicators describing the indication, efficacy and toxicity of personalized treatment will be monitored and available genomic and proteomic data on tumor tissue and its host will be evaluated. We will also continue the analysis of personalized treatment approaches from the previous project (optimization of antifolate, asparaginase, metronomic therapy).

West syndrome usually manifests in infancy or toddlerhood with a characteristic triad of symptoms: epileptic spasms, EEG hypsarrhythmia and psychomotor retardation. Lennox Gastaut syndrome appears later, typically between the second and eighth year of life, often in patients with West syndrome. Even LGS can be simplistically described by a triad of symptoms that includes a variety of epileptic seizures including tonic seizures, slow spike-wave complexes in the EEG, and deterioration of cognitive skills. The factors influencing the evolution of WS to LGS are not clear.

Obtaining large numbers of cells needed for cell therapy or disease modelling requires long-term cultivation under in vitro conditions. However, previous research has found that during long-term in vitro cultivation, base excision repair (BER) activity is significantly reduced due to a decrease in the expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), resulting in an increase in mutation frequency and destabilization of the genome. In our hypothesis, we propose that due to reduced BER activity, not enough double-strand breaks are formed (due to clustered base damage), resulting in insufficient activation of the G1/S checkpoint. Therefore, base damage penetrates further in the cell cycle. This damage should trigger replication fork arrest and activate homologous recombination (HR). However, the increased mutation frequency in late passage LEKBs and cells with downregulated/inhibited APE1 suggests that the HR mechanism might also be less active in late passage cells than in early passage cells. In order to specifically enhance the genomic stability of long-term cultured LEKBs in the future, it is first necessary to analyze and understand the HR and checkpoint mechanisms responsible for eliminating genomic damage. Therefore, the aim of this project will be to analyse HR and checkpoint (cell cycle) activity in relation to long-term LEKB cultivation and BER activity."

In 2014, the project activities will focus on facilities and institutions providing long-term care (social care and social services facilities) compared to the previous year. The project focuses on the development of a clinical guideline for the objective assessment of a patient with a non-healing wound using WHC, WIC and WEC. The project activities will result in an increase in the quality and improvement of care for people with non-healing, hard to heal wounds of various aetiologies in the conditions of clinical nursing practice in social care facilities (Homes for the Elderly) and primary care. It will contribute to the improvement of the quality of care with regard to the unambiguous and validated objective assessment of patients with non-healing wounds throughout the Czech Republic. The objectives of the project are focused on nursing care and in particular the promotion of the competences of general nurses in wound management. The project activities follow on from the mapping of the current state of documentation of care for people with non-healing wounds at the national level in inpatient facilities (a total of187 hospitals) and the subsequent preparation of a recommended procedure in printed form distributed to partner institutions. The final phase of the project will involve validation of the prepared evidence base of objectively assessable assessment techniques in clinical nursing practice. It is therefore an intervention project. The output (electronic version on CD), an e-learning course, will be a draft of clinical recommended algorithms for the care of people with non-healing wounds. The project activities build on the professional activities of the project proponent, who is a member of the committee of the Czech Wound Care Society and works in the preparatory group for KDP in the care of people with non-healing wounds under the auspices of the National Reference Centre (NRC). The e-course is based on the publication by Pokorná - Introduction to Wound Management.

After overcoming certain types of health complications, seniors reach a period in life when illnesses begin to accumulate, the number of medications taken increases, and compensatory mechanisms weaken. The consequence is the gradual onset of age-related frailty with frequent decompensations and a gradual loss of self-sufficiency. The aim of the project is to define the severity of the individual predicted risk factors for loss of self-sufficiency and to develop prophylactic measures to maintain it. Another area addressed by the project is the possibilities of primary prevention of these syndromes, i.e. influencing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis and sarcopenia, dementia and depression in the population of younger age groups, with the time for primary prevention of some of these syndromes starting in the second decade of life

The aim of the 1st sub-project is to introduce a new unique diagnostic method - Contact Heat Evoked Potentials (CHEPS), which allows non-invasive testing of the integrity and dysfunction of thermoalgesic pathways and centres at peripheral and central levels. In addition to the separate analysis of evoked responses, the aim is to perform multimodal registration of CHEPS simultaneously with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which will allow simultaneous study of pain perception mechanisms at the central brain level. This diagnostic tool is available in only a few research centers in the world. The next sub-project will aim to investigate mechanisms of endogenous pain inhibition and facilitation using the ""Conditioned pain modulation""(CMP) and ""Temporal summation"" (TS) methodologies in chronic pain syndromes with a neuropathic component - back pain and multiple sclerosis, including the possibility of predicting the development of neuropathic pain and response to treatment. The last subproject will then aim to test the specificity of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) determination by skin biopsy in the identification of thin fiber neuropathy (SFN) in one of the clinical entities that may mimic SFN - spondylogenic cervical myelopathy (SCM). The need to verify the specificity of the methodology was one of the key points of the recently published AAN recommendation for the use of intraepidermal thin nerve fiber density testing from skin biopsy in the diagnostic algorithm for polyneuropathies (England 2009). Similar findings have never been published in SCM, and of the other entities potently mimicking SFN, only multiple sclerosis has been evaluated (Herrmann, 2010)."

Unlike subjective methods of visual acuity testing, which are better known, objective visual acuity testing is independent of the patient's assessment and response. Thus, it is often used with preverbal children, simulating or dissimulating individuals, deaf individuals, and individuals with mental retardation. Methods of objective visual acuity testing include the preferential vision method, physiological nystagmus, and modified visual evoked potential methods.

MUDr. Ph.D.;1998;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Stomatologická klinika;"The aim of this scientific project is to study functional connectivity between subthalamic nucleus (STN) and cortex in human brain with respect to cognitive functions. The STN is thought to be prominently involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). As such it has become a main therapeutic target for PD treatment. Inactivation of the STN by deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves motor deficits. On the other hand mild to moderate impairment of cognitive functions after STN-DBS is reported in some patients. Thus, besides its key role in motor functions the STN is by most authors also accepted to have impact on non-motor functions. The STN seems to have an anatomically central position within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical associative and limbic loops. Moreover, hypothesis of cortico-STN bypass of the BG-thalamocortical circuitry under some circumstances was introduced recently suggesting that such ""hyperdirect"" connections might underlie the processing of some of the non-motor functions. As the exact role of the STN in non-motor functions as well as mechanisms of cognitive after-effects of STN-DBS are yet unknown, we propose to characterize the cortico-subcortical functional connectivity in PD patients using high density EEG and simultaneous intracranial EEG in STN. In this project we will investigate: 1) whether neuro-electric activity of STN recorded with intracerebral electrodes during cognitive task differs among specific functional microstates defined with simultaneous high density scalp EEG recording, and 2) how parameters of DBS influence the temporal organization of the topographic configuration of the scalp potential fields. We believe that combination of high density EEG with deep brain recording and stimulation may allow conclusions about the role of STN in the cognitive functional networks involved in the generation of the EEG microstates. These new findings will have clinical importance in understanding cognitive after-effects of STN-DBS and in optimization of parameters of DBS."

These microorganisms pose a significant risk to immunocompromised patients. The ability to form biofilms, resistance to antimicrobial agents and other virulence factors influence disease pathogenesis and antimicrobial therapy. The project addresses comprehensively the problem of nosocomial infections caused by these microorganisms, with emphasis on optimisation of diagnostic schemes and the design of new identification and typing methods, including molecular biology techniques and methods based on capillary electrophoresis and Raman spectrometry. The rapid and reliable identification of these microorganisms and the monitoring of their clonality, as well as the demonstration of the presence of virulence factors, are crucial for the implementation of effective preventive measures and the choice of appropriate therapeutic approaches. The epidemiology and clinical significance of these micro-organisms will also be monitored in the project by analysing a sufficient number of clinical isolates. The project also includes the verification of the possibility of controlling some therapeutic approaches, in particular the use of phage therapy and probiotics.

In 2050, the expected share of the older generation 65+ in our country is 33%, i.e. with the current population of 10 million people, there are 3 300 000 seniors. According to the experience to date, approximately 80% of the elderly are able to live in their own environment either independently or with the help of relatives or friends, while 20% of the elderly are dependent on institutional care due to lack of independence. Already today, the waiting time for placement in an institution is as long as 3-4 years, and with the demographic trend described above and an economic situation that does not allow for a significant scale of construction of new facilities, this situation will continue to worsen. Therefore, every individual who enters old age with a minimum of manifested diseases, with preserved fitness and with a realistic hope of living the maximum possible part of old age in their own environment, with preserved self-sufficiency and without the need for external assistance or institutionalisation, will be very valuable.

Ph.D.;106385;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Biologický ústav;The research of the teams working at the Institute of Pharmacology has long focused on preclinical drug research and innovative pharmacological approaches. To this end, we use several approaches, namely: i) the study of innovative mechanisms of action (pharmacodynamic approach), ii) the study of the pharmacokinetic properties of candidate drugs (pharmacokinetic approach) and iii) the study of the heritable variability of the organism's response to drug administration, including the possible influence of cells carrying the genetic information (pharmacogenetic approach). Pharmacodynamic studies focusing mainly on the use of the endocannabinoid system in the brain appear to be an important factor influencing other neurotransmitter systems, e.g. dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic and other pathways. These studies focus on monitoring the activity of the endocannabinoid system in animal models of methamphetamine dependence and depression/schizophrenia as its comorbidities, schizophrenia in neurodevelopmental animal models, and anxiety. Pharmacokinetic studies have focused on the activity of one of the most important biotransforming enzyme systems, cytochrome P450 (CYP). CYP metabolic activity is influenced by many factors such as sex, age, genetic polymorphism, and xenobiotics. Inter-individual differences in CYP activity, cause different rates of drug metabolism between patients and may play a significant role in the safety and efficacy of the agents administered. Determining the effect of used and potential drugs on the activity of this metabolic system is essential to achieve safe and effective drug therapy. Pharmacogenetic studies have focused on the search for associations between the variability of drug response of selected genetic biomarkers at the DNA level and, at the same time, on epigenetically controlled changes in the expression of certain microRNA-encoding genes in tumour tissue in the context of their subsequent possible influence by drug administration. The main objective of the project is to contribute to the research and development of new drugs in indications where the options of current pharmacotherapy are limited, using different pharmacological approaches and validated animal models.

These are manifested by activation of satellite glial cells, invasion of activated macrophages and expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors not only in the spinal ganglia associated with the injured nerve but also in structures of distant segments. The spread of the inflammatory reaction to the spinal ganglia of distant spinal segments may occur via the blood and/or the liquor route. Our earlier experiments demonstrated the penetration of labeled dextran from the liquor and blood into the spinal ganglion, demonstrating the permeability of the blood-nerve and liquor-nerve barrier to cytokine-sized molecules (Joukal et al., 2013).

In this project, we draw on our extensive data regarding the identification of genetic defects at diagnosis (n=425 CLL patients). Of these defects, we intend to exploit potentially fully clonal aberrations (i.e., highly likely to have arisen at the onset of leukemia) and determine whether their occurrence is restricted to CLL cells or whether they extend to other cell populations. The work should contribute to the understanding of CLL formation from a cell population perspective and identify very early defects.

MUDr. Ph.D.;54879;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Psychiatrická klinika;Metastatic melanoma is a malignant tumour that responds very poorly to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, new targeted therapies for this disease are being sought, most often targeting the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway controlling cell proliferation, which is over-activated in malignant melanoma cells by mutations in the BRAF and NRAS oncogenes. Altered energy metabolism in cancer cells is also being intensively studied and offers a number of potential therapeutic targets. The present project combines these two areas of research and aims to validate pilot results suggesting that the way melanoma cells acquire energy may fundamentally affect the activity of the ERK MAP kinase pathway and the response of tumour cells to targeted inhibition of this pathway.

Mutations in BRCA2 predispose to breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer. Mutations in RAD51 together with certain BRCA2 mutations increase the risk of cancer, but other specific mutations in BRCA2 do not. The explanation could be related to the maintenance or disruption of interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51. This hypothesis can be tested using RAD51 mutants and truncated forms of BRCA2. To achieve the research objectives, the rapid kinetics of BRCA2 domains will be studied in relation to stabilization or destabilization of RAD51 polymers on single-stranded DNA. By deciphering the functional importance of these interactions, we will be able to rationalize how BRCA2 functions to maintain genome stability.

In an animal model of CRC (subcutaneous or orthotopic xenotransplantation), the effect of inhibition/substitution of these miRNAs on tumor growth will be evaluated in vivo using CRC cell lines stably transfected with an inhibitor/precursor of the respective miRNA. At the same time, a novel nanoparticle carrier (SPION conjugated with chitosan) will be tested in vitro for the transport of synthetic miRNA precursors/inhibitors into cells. This will be followed by a preclinical study to monitor the efficacy and toxicity of repeated administration of the nanoparticle carrier+precursor/miRNA inhibitor system.

MUDr. Ph.D.;4805;Příjemce;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;The basic principle of flap sculpture is to preserve the vascular supply to the flap to a sufficient extent until the vasculature is established between the flap and the recipient site. In some cases, the pedicle of the flap, which provides the original vascular supply, passes through areas where the patient has been severely restricted aesthetically or functionally for a prolonged period of time. The pedicle of the flap can be discontinued only after the new vascular supply has been established. The positive effect of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) on flap viability and vascular restoration after ischemia-reperfusion injury has been demonstrated experimentally in vivo. The aim of our experimental work is to verify the hypothesized effect of ASCs on the rate of vascular supply generation between the flap and the recipient site and to confirm the hypothesis that by injecting ASCs into the flap, the pedicle of the flap can be disconnected earlier.

These tumours may result from treatment of the first tumour, congenital disposition, lifestyle or environmental factors. Sequencing the genome of normal healthy cells and comparing them with the sequences of cancer cells leads to the identification of new genes involved in the process of carcinogenesis. In our pilot study we would like to focus on sequencing the exomes of patients with duplicated tumours and comparing the spectra of tumour mutations with those found in healthy tissue samples. Our goal is to find associations between primary and secondary tumors at the molecular level and thus contribute to a deeper understanding of their etiopathogenesis.

This reduction is an important pathogenetic mechanism promoting invasiveness and growth of tumor cells. Re-elevation of levels reverses the aggressive phenotype of tumor cells. The decrease in levels is caused by a decrease in the expression of transport mechanisms for Zn2+ and therefore mere supplementation will not lead to an increase in levels. The aim of this project is to synthesize Zn2+ encapsulated in liposomal particles (LIPs) using nanotechnology to ""bypass"" the impaired transport mechanisms. After LIP-Zn2+ treatment, cell invasiveness and expression of genes associated with disease progression will be characterized. In parallel, the efficacy of drugs in combination with neoadjuvant LIP-Zn2+ therapy will be tested; it is expected to increase their effectiveness."

Currently, the process of autophagy is considered to be a key element modulating tumorigenesis, metastasis and tumor response to treatment. In the early stages of tumorigenesis, autophagy acts as a tumor suppressor, preventing the cellular accumulation of damaged proteins causing the production of reactive oxygen species. In advanced tumors and metastases, it is a mechanism to overcome the adverse conditions and effects of chemotherapy. The aim of this project is to unravel the true role of autophagy in the resistance of prostate cancer cells to the action of conventional and modern cytostatic drugs, and to identify specific miRNAs that could be used clinically to select adequate therapy.

Furthermore, previously unexpected links between centrosome anomalies and a plethora of human diseases and developmental defects have been uncovered. This in turn raises the prospect of exploiting centrosome-related pathways for therapeutic applications. Moreover, recent evidence from in vivo models (fly, mice) strongly suggests a context-dependent role for a centrosome in proliferation and differentiation. Hence, this raises an intriguing possibility of cell type-specific requirements for a correct number of centrosomes during their proliferation and terminal differentiation. However, our current understanding of the role of centrosome in such processes is surprisingly sparse.

The purpose of this project is to bring together high quality national and international laboratories to unravel the functional link between induced and genetically modeled pathologies of cardiac electrophysiology at the cellular and whole organism level. Using advanced technologies for induction of pluripotent cells and their differentiation, an artificial biological pacemaker will be created to correct the model ablation of the cardiac conduction system. More efficient differentiation into CMs with spontaneous activity will be achieved by induced expression of specific ion channels in these cells. Unique functional testing of the cells will allow detailed analysis of the cells used for cell therapy before and after transplantation, similar to the analysis of model diseases. The above measurement of electrical activity combined with contractile force measurements has never before been used to characterize cardiac cells. The ablation and transgenic models represent an ideal intersection of the use of artifactual CMs and potential therapies.

In the last two decades, the issue of KBs has penetrated almost all fields of biological sciences, especially due to the therapeutic potential of KBs from the perspective of regenerative medicine, or the possibility of targeting KBs in serious diseases, including cancer. This makes KB research highly multidisciplinary and as such requires a shared and focused effort to achieve practical applications. In line with this requirement, collaborations have previously been established between some teams in the Czech Republic investigating different aspects of different types of KB. This project proposes to build on these links and to complete them into a Centre bringing together six top teams from six distinguished institutions in three regions of the Czech Republic. Thanks to the complementarity of the expertise and instrumentation of the individual teams, the range of KB types studied, and the new degree of research coordination, the established Centre will raise the research and educational activities of the Czech Republic in the field of KB research to a level that would otherwise be impossible to achieve.

At the level of all organisms, these pressures are offset by a network of DNA damage response (DDR) processes that mediate genome control and repair. The biological significance of these processes is evident from the fact that defects in the DDR network predispose to various serious diseases and their subsequent development. The proposed project involves 6 teams with synergistic models and expertise to identify novel components and regulation of DDR responses, contributing to the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms and coordination of DNA replication, recombination and repair. The project will also provide low-molecular-weight modulators of key DDR enzymes, enabling the development and validation of tools to better understand the mechanisms and aberrant processes that constitute protection against factors that threaten genome integrity. This output will enable the development of innovative therapies as well as the optimization of existing therapeutic regimens used to treat cancer.

Primarily, we will prepare particles of various compositions chemically and/or physically. These particles will be characterized to found their shapes and dimensions. Then, the particles will be modified with various chemical agents and biomolecules as peptides, proteins and nucleic acids. Particles of defined shapes and dimensions with modified surface will be primarily tested on tumour and non-tumour cell lines. The particles will be monitored by modern in vivo imaging methods including confocal microscopy and optical tomography. The optimized in vivo imaging protocols will be subsequently applied to experimental animals bearing tumours. The particles will serve on side as labels of tumour development and as tools for targeted drugs delivery that may overcome resistance and decrease drug side effects. Both applications will be investigated to find types of materials and modifications suitable for in vivo imaging and drug delivery systems.

We hypothesize that during the pathogenesis of MM, the expression of a set of genes associated with the activation of cell cycle progression is in dynamic equilibrium with the expression of a set of genes inhibiting this process.  This equilibrium functions as a compensatory mechanism for oncogenic events. Despite the existence of a compensatory mechanism, the regulation of the cell cycle is not balanced because of the increasing ""oncogenic pressure"" during the pathogenesis of MM. We hypothesize that at any given time, different subpopulations of MM cells are present in the body that may constitute a reservoir for tumor renewal, growth, and dissemination.  We hypothesize that B cells are crucial here and serve as the starting point for initiating oncogenic events in MM cells. New findings based on basic research could be translated into applied research, which could help overcome the lethal consequences of the disease."

At the cellular level, zinc ions influence proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy. Zinc ions are very important in a number of pathologies, including the pathogenesis of prostate tumours. Prostate cells are unique in their relationship to zinc ions. Physiologically, up to tenfold accumulation of these ions occurs in the prostate. However, tumour tissue lacks the ability to accumulate zinc and its concentration decreases significantly. This project is aimed at unraveling the effect of zinc ions on animal viability, vital functions and nutrition, as well as testing zinc-resistant prostate tumor lines and their migratory and invasive potential. The solution of this project will allow further development and understanding of the transport and metabolism of zinc ions, especially in aggressive forms of prostate cancer, with the possible design of targeted therapeutic intervention.

We found that the ubiquitin-specific protease USP48 is a novel binding partner of Mdm2, and that its presence can significantly increase Mdm2 levels in the cell. Unlike other deubiquitinating enzymes involved in Mdm2 regulation, USP48-mediated Mdm2 stabilization is not associated with a change in ubiquitination levels, suggesting that it occurs by a non-canonical mechanism independent of deubiquitination. In other, similar experiments, we have found that some proteins of the MAGE (Melanoma-associated antigens) family can affect the level of the MdmX oncogene in the cell. High expression of both USP and MAGE family proteins may be involved in carcinogenesis and the proposed project should contribute to understanding the mechanisms involved in the increase of Mdm2 and MdmX levels by USP48 and MAGE proteins and determine their role in inhibiting p53 activity in cancer cells.

This response functions as a complex network in which alternative and often redundant pathways work in parallel. Recent studies have shown that partial disruption of this network in a tumour cell leads to the cell's dependence on a single DNA repair pathway. This can potentially be exploited in the search for therapies that target the pathways involved in DDR. Knowledge of the redundancy of these pathways may be particularly important in cancer cells, where the so-called ""synthetic lethality"" (SL) approach can be used. The aims of the project are to: i) predict SL interactions in human cells based on data obtained in yeast; ii) confirm novel SL interactions using siRNA/shRNA or cells lacking any of the important proteins involved in the DDR; iii) specifically disrupt selected SL interactions with already known or newly designed inhibitors. The results of this research will provide a novel approach in the treatment of tumors with impaired DNA repair mechanisms that will have minimal side effects on the organism."

Thus, centers included in the program provide medical care to virtually all patients in their country. In addition, each of the topics dealt by Euretino is the subject of expertise of one, and occasionally more than one major national referral center. Namely, examples of vast expertise in these topics include: the VUMC Hospital in Amsterdam in long-term sequelae especially second malignancies, the Institute Curie in chemotherapy treatment of intraocular and extraocular disease, CHUV Hospital in conservative treatment, Universitätsklinikum Essen in the molecular diagnosis of RB1 gene mutation. This provides an opportunity of leading, generalizing and multiplying their expertise with the other participants in the context of the network. These centers provide national coverage to virtually all retinoblastoma patients and they are referral centers for training and consultation at a global level. Included also in Euretino are all centers that are currently taking care of retinoblastoma patients in Spain, Italy, UK, France, Netherlands, Belgiium, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In these cases, treatment is de-centralized but, all centers treating retinoblastoma patients are included, so they represent accurately the situation at a national level. Some of them are historical leaders in different fields of retinoblastoma care. It is expected that as a result of this network a more harmonized standard of care would be achieved.

Complications linked to anaemia involve all medical fields: functional decline, frailty, immobility, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, compromising independence and quality of life. Not to forget the relevant implications on socio-economic, healthcare and public costs. A European well-defined cooperative project is mandatory. Our proposal is the development of an integrated clinical, geriatric and biological network (ENEA, European Network Elderly Anemia) aimed at defining and piloting a European shared diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm on anemia approach of elderly frail patients. The aim is to discover, through innovative techniques such as next generation sequencing (NGS), novel insights of the mechanisms underlying anemia and its complications, to identify diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The following step is providing personalized tailored treatments and improving therapy adherence in specific stratified subsets of patients.

By appropriate inhibition or activation of these receptors by drugs, pathological processes could be inhibited or desired processes could be promoted. However, the development of such drugs is very costly, as only one specific receptor needs to be targeted each time from a family of similar receptor kinases. Specificity testing of the therapeutic under development is a key step in its development, where the effect of a given chemical on the activity of not only the targeted receptor but also structurally related proteins needs to be verified. Our laboratory has a library of 331 RTK receptors and a luciferase reporter, which together form a unique platform for testing potential inhibitors and activators of RTK signaling. However, the luciferase reporter was developed and tested to measure the activity of only one RTK signaling pathway, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway. The object of this sub-project is to test the effect of all 331 RTK receptors on the activity of the luciferase reporter (proof of concept) and possibly modify the reporter promoter sequence into multiple variants so that the activity of other RTK signalling pathways can be detected. The resulting promoter element(s) will be transferred in front of open reading frames of different types of reporters (luciferase - cypridine, nanoluc; fluorescent - GFP; enzymatic - LacZ) so that the activity of FGF/RTK signalling can also be read in combination with other commercially available reporters of other signalling pathways (which are also based on luciferase). Eventually, cell lines will be prepared that will have the FGF/RTK reporter already integrated, which will make the reporter easier to work with."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently identified RNA molecules that have been implicated as essential intracellular mediators of processes involved in adaptation to locomotor activity, including angiogenesis, inflammation, mitochondrial metabolism, contractile force generation in cardiac/skeletal muscle, and muscle hypertrophy. Although circulating miRNA molecules (c-miRNAs) have been studied as biomarkers in a number of diseases, data defining the role of c-miRNAs under conditions of acute training load and long-term training in healthy subjects are lacking, and the body of knowledge is very limited in the elderly population. There is also little information on the correlation between c-miRNA and urinary miRNA expression in the elderly. This project is concerned with defining the expression profiles of specific miRNAs in different body fluids (serum/urine) in seniors enrolled in different types of training (endurance, strength, endurance-strength) and relates them to aerobic fitness parameters (VO2max - calculated from the value of a 2-minute step-test) and anthropometric parameters. The present project uniquely combines the approaches of modern physiology, molecular epigenetics and sports science (exercise physiology) and its outputs will contribute to improving the understanding of the role of microRNAs in adaptation to physical exercise in healthy populations, with special benefits for the particularly vulnerable elderly population.

Despite this, the problem of interaction between biological systems and magnetic fields is not solved. The main goal of the project is to make a fundamental contribution to the understanding of human magnetoreception through an interdisciplinary approach and unique technical equipment. The project builds on two current facts: 1) the phenomenon of human magnetoreception has reached a level where it can build on the firmly established methodological and knowledge base built by the study of animal magnetoreception, in which the proposer's group has a stake. 2) Advances in neuroscience make it possible, thanks to new tools, to discover the neural basis of previously only empirically known psychogenic, paranormal or other phenomena, hitherto unexplained by previous methods (e.g. the déjà-vu phenomenon described by the Neuroscience staff). The plan of cooperation of 5 subjects from MU is based on these, giving a unique and original combination of methods and approaches.

Geophysics (UGVPr.fak.) is able to define physically precise field anomalies of magnetic field and to perform experiments with the response of a large group of experimental subjects. Neuroscience (CEITEC and LF) is able to approach both the mechanism of reception and the involvement of brain structures by monitoring behavioral, motor and electrophysiological characteristics of positive responders in the laboratory. Using 3T NMR, it can detect possible anatomical variations and functional, effective connectivity between selected brain regions. The FSS workstation will provide a control for the psychological factors necessarily accompanying human magnetoreception research, the absence of which may have had a major impact on the heterogeneity of results from previous studies. Integral processing and interpretation of heterogeneous data, control of the experimental design, and subsequent data processing is handled in the project in collaboration with IBA bioinformaticians.

Encapsulation of already proven chemotherapeutics with cavitands such as cucurbit[n]urils or suitable nanomaterials seems to be a promising approach for cancer therapy. The use of PtIV-based agents, possibly based on non-platinum metals (e.g. ruthenium), is also a promising alternative to this approach. PtIV-based agents generally show lower reactivity compared to classical platinum-based cytostatics. The project is based on the hypothesis that a rational design of cavitands (carriers) and thoughtful modifications of platinum (PtIV) and ruthenium (RuIII) based drugs can be used to significantly reduce toxicity to non-tumor tissues and improve targeting of their effect compared to commonly used chemotherapeutics. This project will compare the efficacy and mechanism of action of cytostatics conventionally used to treat the relevant prostate (docetaxel), breast (doxorubicin), and colorectal (cisplatin derivatives) diseases (a) with newly synthesized platinumIV and rutheniumIII based drugs, (b) with conventional drugs encapsulated in cavitands, (c) with newly synthesised derivatives encapsulated in cavitands, and (d) with cavitands modified for further drug targeting. Thus, the work has the following objectives: (1) design, preparation and characterization of novel modifications of platinum and ruthenium drugs and supramolecular complexes of new and existing chemotherapeutics with cavitands such as cucurbiturils, cyclodextrins, calixarenes, (2) comparison of cytotoxic effect of novel platinum and ruthenium derivatives versus drugs routinely used for the treatment of breast cancer, prostate and colorectal cancer in in vitro experiments, (3) Detailed characterization of the effect of the new platinum and ruthenium derivatives on the above-mentioned cancer cell lines - analysis of gene expression at the mRNA and protein level, analysis of changes in cellular processes and cell death, analysis of metallome changes in cells (distribution of platinum and ruthenium and other metals - zinc, copper, iron, etc.), (4) Validation of in-vitro experiments on in-vivo mouse models after induction of colorectal, breast and prostate tumors. Laser ablation methods with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry as well as confocal microscopy will be used.

In this context, we also assume differences in the parameters studied between walking on solid ground and on a treadmill. Methods such as formometry, kinematic analysis and dynamometry, which allow the analysis of the main parameters identifying gait, can be a very accurate indicator of changes in gait, both when comparing gait on solid ground and treadmill, and when investigating gait pathologies caused by injuries or inappropriate footwear, etc. Following these methods, we will develop standards for evaluating the effectiveness of medical therapy for lower limb trauma conditions. The aim of the project is to develop and experimentally validate a gait norm defined mainly by the distribution of plantar pressures and kinematic and dynamic gait parameters, both for walking on a fixed base and on a tread. The added value of the planned ""basic gait research"" will be the subsequent use of the experimentally verified gait norms for follow-up research, e.g. in the field of the influence of specific footstools on the condition of the foot arch in different population groups, or in the field of rehabilitation diagnosis of post-injury conditions of the lower limbs.

From the measured data a typology of gait and stride will be made and an interval standard of optimal gait and distribution of plantar pressures during gait will be developed. The interval norms will mainly reflect age and somatic parameters. Typologies of the plantar stride will be based on an assessment of the time course of plantar pressures and forces applied during the stride. The next step of the research will then be to apply scoring systems to the process of gait and foot arch assessment in specific population groups. The final step of the project will then be an accurate and comprehensive description of an experimentally validated method for applying the developed standard in gait and foot arch assessment for research applications. After the development of the methodology for comparing selected gait parameters, the basis for publication of the key findings at an international conference and in an impacted journal, Research Quarterly or similar, will be developed."

MUDr. Ph.D.;2042;Příjemce;LF;I. neurologická klinika;Since the 1970s, technological advances have become a major factor in the rising cost of health care delivery around the world. The need and interest to create and apply innovative modern practices in medicine is increasingly coming up against resource constraints.

Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is one such tool. Finding a balance between economic perspectives and models, the desire to stem the increase in spending and to maintain the affordability of interventions, together with the new ethical challenges posed by personalised medicine, is a complex process. It is essential to conduct these evaluations according to sophisticated and standardised methodologies, which are currently absent at national level. Therefore, one of the proposed pillars and objectives of the project is methodologically oriented research with the development of a proposal for an adequate methodology that takes into account European standards and national specificities. A basic prerequisite for the successful implementation and realisation of HTA is the availability of the necessary data, not only structured clinical data, but also data related to the assessment of the cost of care. Therefore, the next objective of the project is to map the availability and data base for HTA, modelling it on the example of care for diabetic patients. Diabetes is a societally important disease that has significant economic and social implications in addition to the medical aspects of treatment. The costs of treatment of these are drawn partly from health insurance, but at the same time have a significant financial impact in the social sphere. Only a part of these costs are the costs of primary treatment, while the greater part of the funds is spent on the treatment of chronic complications. For these reasons, the diabetic care

In the vast majority, their manifestations include heart failure. Research on the process of mechanical heart failure at the cellular and molecular level can be observed and modeled already on individual cardiac cells. Cardiomyocytes can be obtained without intervention in the cardiac tissue by differentiation from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Cardiac cells are thus grown and beating in a laboratory dish, just a small piece of donor skin. If the donor is a person with a hereditary heart disease, mechanical and electrical manifestations can be observed in the heart cells.

Ph.D.;56694;Příjemce;LF;Ústav zdravotnických věd; However, growth on normal surfaces does not allow iPS-cardiomyocytes to contract freely and limits their full maturation. The poor biological response of cardiac cells is manifested by their conversion into connective tissue (fibroblasts) and loss of mechanical function.

Ph.D.;63698;Příjemce;LF;Biochemický ústav; The primary goal of this work is to find a substrate that does not limit contractility, prevents conversion and promotes cardiomyocyte growth. This can be achieved using novel nanomaterials based on biopolymers. These materials have excellent elasticity due to their polymer base and high porosity. They thus support the growth of adult cardiac cells in an animal model.

The surface modification can be done plasmochemically, by applying a special kind of low-temperature electric plasma to the surface. Functional chemical groups can be generated on the treated surfaces to provide the biocompatibility sought. Plasmochemical reactions are often combined with classical chemical reactions for higher efficiency. Another goal of this work is to adapt the substrate surface to promote the specialization, growth, maturation and mechanical function of iPS-cardiomyocytes.

MUDr. Ph.D.;1100;Příjemce;LF;Mikrobiologický ústav; A third sub-objective is to culture cardiomyocytes under stress conditions (under drug and mechanical stress) and to monitor changes in their functional properties. At the single cell level, contractions can be described using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Molecular biology methods can be used to describe changes in the structural properties of cells and their metabolism. At the level of the individual cardiomyocyte, we can thus monitor the mechanisms causing heart failure in the body and search for new drugs and therapeutic approaches for its treatment.

Ph.D.;59873;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Ústav zdravotnických věd;Human being experiences itself as a whole. Experience of bodily and mental events is integrated in the subjective mind. Although the experience is immediate, non-inferential, it requires integration of processes on many levels, both biological and psychological ones. The project aims at the development of an interdisciplinary platform for comprehensive research of body-brain-mind interactions to provide the synergy of tools, approaches and intellectual capacity. We will test the hypothesis that reduced integration abilities manifested on many levels of brain organization (from neurons to brain networks) are reflected in the impaired integration of mind - we will specifically test it by analysis of the ability to integrate the information about the body in the mind, to integrate borders of bodily self, and to integrate novel information into context during psychotherapy. To achieve this we will use schizophrenia as a model that exhibits a reduction in integration abilities. The major progress beyond the state of the art is the analysis of neural networks using computational tools, cellular pathophenotypic profiling using patient-specific glutamatergic neurons, advanced neuroimaging analyses of neuronal networks and connectivity with virtual reality simulations to provide ecological validity of behavioral paradigms, and novel approaches of the research of psychotherapy. We will employ medicine, psychological and social science approaches, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology (biology), mathematics and computational approaches.Through interdisciplinary collaborations, we will obtain pathophysiology in individual schizophrenic patients at multifaceted levels from cell, brain, to behaviour. More importantly we will inform analyses on higher levels by findings on lower levels, thus bridging gaps between experiential and observational realms.

MUS81 plays a critical role in resolution of late replication and recombination intermediates essential for proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. Its absence leads to accumulation of anaphase bridges, chromosomal breaks and fusions. Recent literature indicates that MUS81 represents a very promising target for pharmacological intervention, especially in the area of new anticancer therapies. It should be noted that until 2014, no crystal structure of human MUS81 was known. This, together with the fact that no small-molecule inhibitors of MUS81 have been reported yet, presents an excellent starting point for academic high-risk/high-gain project. This project represents a unique interdisciplinary approach for proper medicinal chemistry optimization of our proprietary hit (compound 1B) together with its extensive in vitro and in vivo characterization. Furthermore, we will identify synthetic lethal partners for MUS81 deficiency with primary focus on clinically relevant genes. This together should lead to advanced leads that will be suitable for further preclinical (and possibly clinical) progression.
51347;0924/2015;Circulating long non-coding RNA molecules as markers of multiple myeloma;Bollová Božena, Mgr.;408863;Příjemce;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;The aim of the project is to analyse individual, professional, social, economic and political perceptions of dignity at the end of life in the Czech Republic. We start from the assumption that ideas about dying with dignity do not always meet the lived reality. The end of life is understood as the period during the last year of life of a patient/individual who is suffering from a terminal illness and/or dying of old age, - i.e. he/she knows about his/her approaching end of life and consciously (un)prepares for it. This is a highly topical and universal topic that affects all of us, but at the same time, in our culture, it is a very sensitive and even taboo topic that is not publicly discussed. The FSS MU, LF MU and ESF MU came together in a consortium to develop the research plan. The chosen methodology is multiparadigmatic. The qualitative team will collect a research sample of 150 interviews with persons at the end of life, their families and health care personnel, conduct participant observation of the end-of-life site (hospital, hospice, home) and prepare a content analysis of secondary data available from public portals and publications of the Ministry of Health and selected health insurance companies in order to describe perceptions of dignity at the end of life from the perspective of the individual, his/her caring family/relatives and health care/care personnel. The qualitative team will analyse unique and so far unprocessed social science data from the database of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) in order to focus on information about the economic demands of the last year of life of the dying person, as well as the political decisions behind the implemented expenditures. This will introduce the government's end-of-life with dignity policy. The main output of the research will be a joint monograph that will make a significant and unique contribution to the informed academic, social, economic and political debate on dying in the Czech Republic today.

This project combining the biological (Faculty of Science), biomedical (Faculty of Medicine) and informational (Faculty of Information) aspects of scientific research proposes to link three departments of Masaryk University in order to test the functionality and usefulness of analysing 3D optical recordings in the form of three-dimensional networks using real clinical data. For this purpose, data obtained by examining volunteers involved in the Kadiovision 2030 project of the International Clinical Research Centre of St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno, which maps morphological and physiological indicators of the human body with the aim of preventing cardiovascular diseases, will be used. The second source will be clinical data obtained during regular examinations of pregnant women with a focus on the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus in collaboration with the Institute of Pathological Physiology of the Faculty of Medicine and the University Hospital in Brno. The project will result in the establishment of new links for the use of 3D recordings of biological objects in clinical biomedical studies, the gain of scientific outputs referring to the extent and relevance of the application of 3D models in the diagnosis of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and the gain of new results developing current knowledge in the areas of optimization of comparison of three-dimensional networks, numerical and visual expression of variability of 3D recordings and advanced (statistical) analysis of captured geometry. In the course of the solution, interpretation, motivation and visualisation aids for clinical disciplines will be further developed using modern information technologies (software, mobile applications) to facilitate doctor-patient communication.

Skeletal muscle involvement is evident before the age of 10 and is closely monitored and evaluated neurologically. However, due to the immobility of the patients, the cardiac muscle involvement remains hidden and is only evident with a large decrease in ejection fraction. Correlation of the neurological scale used with (i) severity of cardiac involvement (according to MRI: CMR) ii) the phenotype manifested at the tissue and cardiac stem and progenitor cell level (analysis of cardiac involvement in the MDX mouse in relation to the degree of musculoskeletal involvement in the animal model) and iii) the cellular phenotype (in hiPSCs-differentiated cardiomyocytes in relation to cardiomyocyte involvement in the MDX mouse) will subsequently allow the search for new drugs using hiPSCs-CMs and the development of new recommendations for earlier diagnosis and treatment implementation. At the same time, a detailed description of the fibrotic process at the level of individual cells and the replacement of affected cardiomyocytes in DMD/BMD patients will allow an improved understanding of the general process of heart failure.

Ways have been found to use combinations of transcription factors and small molecules to create cells from differentiated somatic cells that exhibit characteristics of other tissue types or pluripotent stem cells, which modern regenerative medicine is of course trying to exploit.
49851;0666/2015;Antitumor activity of fluoroquinolone antibiotics;Uldrijan Stjepan, Mgr. CSc.;104691;Příjemce;LF;Biologický ústav; In our own experiments aimed at reprogramming cancer cells, we have found combinations of low molecular weight compounds that allow their transdifferentiation into neuron-like cells. Some of the tested combinations, when timed appropriately and after addition of other chemical inhibitors, showed the ability to reprogram the epigenome even in normal non-tumor fibroblasts to express the specific neural marker Tuj1. The present project is aimed at validation of the obtained results and at further gradual optimization of these combinations of substances so that even by chemical reprogramming of fibroblasts and astrocytes alone, cells showing characteristics of specific types of neurons can be obtained.
49849;0664/2015;Molecular typing of the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis in ticks and samples isolated from patients in South Moravia;Šmajs David, prof. MUDr. Ph.D.;1116;Příjemce;LF;Biologický ústav;The proposed project will determine how metastatic melanoma cells respond to selected fluoroquinolone antibiotics and identify factors that may influence the therapeutic activity of these agents against melanoma. The results of our preliminary experiments suggest that enoxacin and related antibiotics can inhibit melanoma growth, likely due to their ability to induce changes in miRNA expression. Our preliminary results also show that fluoroquinolone antibiotics can activate the p53 pathway, possibly by affecting the level of the cellular oncogene Mdm4, which is overexpressed in many human melanomas. By studying global expression changes using expression chips and a novel CRISPR/Cas-9 technology, we will find cellular pathways affected by fluoroquinolones whose deregulation could serve to predict the sensitivity of melanoma cells to this class of therapeutics. We also intend to determine the mechanism leading to p53 activation following fluoroquinolone treatment and to determine whether p53 or Mdm4 status affects the sensitivity of melanoma cells to these agents.

MUDr. Ph.D.;1116;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Biologický ústav;Lyme borreliosis is the most common zoonosis in Europe and is caused by spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group. The geographical distribution of the different Borrelia species and their genotypic variants depends on the climatic conditions of the area and the presence of different natural hosts and vectors. Therefore, we are planning a detailed molecular mapping of the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis in ticks in South Moravia. As Lyme borreliosis agents differ in their ability to cause differently severe manifestations of the disease, we plan to perform molecular typing of these agents isolated from clinical material of patients and compare the occurrence of different genotypes and different symptoms of Lyme borreliosis. In addition, we plan to perform further mapping based on the differences of synthesized antibodies in patient sera.  The expected outcome of this project will be a detailed mapping of molecular types of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in South Moravia and improvement of Lyme borreliosis diagnosis.
49847;0662/2015;Genetic, proteomic and metabolic profiling of adipokines in pre-eclampsia;Dobrovolná Julie, prof. MUDr. Ph.D.;4805;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA) is the causative agent of the venereal disease syphilis. Worldwide, over 10 million new cases of syphilis are diagnosed annually. With the development of genomics, two molecular typing systems have been developed for detailed characterization of TPA strains. However, the typing efficiency and discriminatory power of these systems varies considerably. The aim of this project is to develop a new, highly reliable and efficient molecular typing system to monitor the genetic diversity of TPA and map the occurrence of treponemal strains on a global scale. The discriminatory power of the new typing system will be tested on genetically distinct clinical isolates and samples from different locations around the world. The new typing system will then be applied to TPA strains that have been isolated from syphilis patients in the Czech Republic, in order to obtain information on the distinctiveness and representation of different TPA genotypes in our country. The molecular data will then be correlated with available epidemiological data.
49828;0661/2015;The microbiome in difficult-to-manage infections;Veselý Radek, prof. MUDr. Ph.D.;56086;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Klinika traumatologie;Pre-eclampsia is a specific disease associated with the period of pregnancy, which is burdened with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. At present, there are no definitive biochemical markers that can be used for early estimation of the risk of pre-eclampsia in a given pregnancy. Thus, the characterization of new molecular markers that will allow for the actionable prediction of the risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy, as well as the prediction of clinical response, is a prerequisite for individualizing treatment, which is highly desirable. Adipokines are a group of molecules predominantly expressed in adipose tissue that are also significantly involved in physiological and pathophysiological processes associated with pregnancy. Therefore, specific adipokine expression profiles in the context of their genetic background and metabolic profiles could represent potential diagnostic and predictive biomarkers. Understanding the mechanisms involving adipokines in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for this serious disease.

The project will also involve the isolation, characterisation and identification of novel bacterial strains (microbiome) that are not commonly present in samples from patients suffering from difficult to manage bacterial infections. Examples of methods that can be used include mass spectrometry on a MALDI/TOF instrument, polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for bacterial strains or barcoding. The identified bacterial strains will be further evaluated for their possible resistance to conventional antibiotic drugs. Last but not least, the project will study the effect of alternative types of substances with antibacterial effect on bacterial cultures with the above mentioned resistance to commonly available and used drugs.

Ph.D.;7263;Příjemce;LF;Mikrobiologický ústav;Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and has a range of non-motor symptoms including anxiety/anxiety in addition to motor symptoms. The relationship between anxiety and PN is not well understood. A better understanding of the symptom itself is essential to improve diagnostic accuracy and to conduct research into therapeutic approaches for anxiety. The unknown origin of anxiety in PN also leads to a lack of information regarding its temporal occurrence during the onset and development of PN. We plan to conduct detailed neurological, psychological and psychiatric examinations of patients at the same time as conducting anxiety-specific questionnaire methods to obtain detailed information on anxiety phenotypes in the early and late stages of PN. Neurobiological aspects of anxiety will be further evaluated using MRI methods (fMRI, sMRI and DTI) to describe the involvement of neuroanatomical structural and functional circuits in the development of anxiety specifically in PN patients.

Representatives of this genus are causative agents of very serious diseases. M. tuberculosis causes tuberculosis (TB) and other representatives, e.g. M. avium and M. fortuitum, cause serious mycobacterioses affecting various organ systems: respiratory tract, skin, musculoskeletal system. Although the Czech Republic is one of the countries with a low incidence of TB, homeless people and migrants from countries with a high incidence of TB are at risk. In these countries, there is insufficient monitoring of the development of resistance to antituberculosis drugs, leading to an increased incidence of multidrug-resistant strains. HIV-positive people are another group at risk.

The molecular mechanism of EM pathogenesis remains unclear. The development of EM appears to be associated with secondary changes in plasma cell gene expression and a very aggressive disease course. This may be due to changes in signaling in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, where cytokines, exosomes and microRNA molecules play a significant role. The aim of this project will be to monitor the clinical course of the disease, determine the flow cytometric profile of EM cells, and characterize the bone marrow microenvironment with respect to cytokine profiles, microRNA signaling and exosome signaling that may contribute to the development of the EM form of the disease. The grant will result in elucidating the pathogenesis of this relapse.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting the CD20 surface antigen have helped to improve the therapeutic response of CLL patients. However, resistance (low efficacy) in some patients remains a problem. The aim of the project is to develop a system to predict treatment response in CLL patients undergoing therapy with the most commonly used treatment regimens involving anti-CD20 antibodies. Methodologically, the project will include experiments on peripheral blood samples from CLL patients, namely (a) analysis of recurrent mutations that could affect the primary antibody response and also contribute to disease relapse, (b) in vitro assays from whole blood and isolated CLL cells testing the efficacy of antibodies alone and in combination with chemotherapy, (c) analysis of activation of antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity, and (d) determination of complement activity in CLL patients. The project is expected to contribute to the announced priority objective 'tumour biology in relation to diagnostic and therapeutic targets'.

MUDr. Ph.D.;2524;Partner;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;A potential complication of angiosurgical procedures on the abdominal aorta is ischemia of intra-abdominal organs. Acute intestinal ischemia (acute mesenteric ischemia - AMI) is one of the most serious. The reported incidence of AMI after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) resection is 3% for elective and up to 60% for emergent procedures, with a mortality rate of up to 90%. Early detection of AMI is absolutely essential to initiate treatment while the condition is still reversible. Clinical diagnosis of AMI is very difficult, and there is no specific laboratory marker. Diagnostic imaging methods are limited by sensitivity and specificity. Angiography and colonoscopy are invasive, limited in availability and not always feasible. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and microRNA are new technologies potentially suitable for early diagnosis of AMI. Changes in the concentrations of these markers in response to ischemic insults have already been described for other organs. We believe that kinetic analysis of IMA and circulating microRNA concentrations allows monitoring of tissue ischemia after aortic reconstruction and potentially early diagnosis of AMI.

MUDr. Ph.D.;1681;Partner;LF;I. chirurgická klinika;Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAC) from cerebral artery aneurysm rupture is a serious condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. The most commonly studied pathologies associated with SAK are early brain injury (EBI) and cerebral artery vasospasm. Transient global cerebral hypoxia and inflammation play an important role in the pathophysiology of EBI. Transient global cerebral ischemia occurs immediately after SAC and affects the brain as a whole. If markers of ischemia could be detected early after SAC and if there was a relationship between these markers and inflammation or severity of hemorrhage, then markers of ischemia could serve diagnostic purposes, early prediction of the patient's end-state, and could also be a potential target for treatment. The aim of this study is to describe the relationship of cerebral ischemia markers to inflammation parameters in an experimental model of SAK.

However, it has an essence at the level of individual cells. At the same time, drug-induced heart failure is a serious and frequent complication of cancer chemotherapy (e.g., anthracyclines). Both processes seem to have a common denominator in calcium metabolism. So-called calcium overload is the dominant pathophysiological mechanism, both in genetic cardiomyopathies associated with Ryanodine receptor (RyR) mutations and its interaction with anthracyclines. The project aims to develop a protocol to induce drug-induced functional and electrical failure of cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells. Cell lines carrying the RyR mutation underlying inherited cardiomyopathy and control lines without known mutation will be used. Subsequently, comparison of viability, changes in metabolism and gene expression will be possible. Last but not least, changes in mechanical and electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes.

MUDr. CSc.;212;Partner;LF;Děkanát;Cell cycle dysregulation is one of the cornerstones of any malignant transformation and monoclonal gammopathies are no exception. In monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma, significantly increased expression of the gene for cyclin D1 is probably redundant and does not lead to cell cycle progression because of the quiescent state of most malignant cells. Thus, it is likely that once complete malignant transformation has occurred, the crucial G1/S cell cycle checkpoint can no longer be regulated by deterrent mechanisms and potentially increased cyclin D levels leading to complete mitosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that the expression of a set of genes with an activating effect on the cell cycle is in dynamic equilibrium with a set of genes responsible for its inhibition, thus serving as a compensatory mechanism. However, the accumulation of carcinogenic events during progression to plasma cell leukemia results in insufficient control of the cell cycle by these inhibitors, leading to the overcoming of restriction points during mitosis.

Polyploid giant cancer cells, a special subpopulation of the cancer cells, contribute to the cellular heterogeneity observed in many solid tumours and show cancer stem cell-like properties. So, PGCCs represent mechanism that cancer cells use to achieve malignant growth. The project will solve the fundamental questions about the mechanism of the formation of PGCCs, chronological order of cellular processes leading to PGCCs formation and their further behaviour and interactions with non-PGCCs. Results obtained will significantly improve our knowledge about the PGCCs and will contribute to the substantial improvement of the anti-cancer strategy and therapy in the future.

The project involves investigating the effect of lignans on a series of resistant cell lines with increased expression of ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein. The experiments will focus on isolating lignans from the Schisandra chinensis plant according to their ability to enhance the accumulation of the cytostatic doxorubicin in resistant cancer cells. Methods based on 1D and 2D capillary HPLC will be developed for efficient analysis of structurally very close lignans. Activity-driven isolation of lignans from plant material and their semi-synthetic modification will allow obtaining more active derivatives and finding key structural requirements necessary for efficient P-glycoprotein inhibition.

Recently, a new concept of changing cell identity has been introduced. The short-term ectopic expression of genes that can dedifferentiate a cell leads to the induction of a plastic state, where the cells thus generated can be differentiated into the desired tissue. In this way, functional neurons, blood and other cell types have been generated from fibroblasts. Cell plasticity induction technology is potentially suitable for use in cell therapy, but the introduction of exogenous genes poses a significant risk for clinical use. The main goal of this project is to eliminate genetic manipulation by manipulating microRNA molecules. To this end, we will identify microRNA molecules that are key to inducing cell plasticity and test whether cells dedifferentiated in this way can be transdifferentiated into the desired cell type.

Its disturbances are the cause of serious diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, heart attack and stroke. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of the different types of PCD and their interconnections is essential for the development of new drugs. Using inhibitors of key molecules of each PCD, we have found that cells respond differently to different cytotoxic agents. The alkaloid sanguilutin (SL) exclusively induced necroptosis in A375 melanoma cells, whereas camptothecin (CXP) induced apoptosis. Other alkaloids (e.g. chelirubin) triggered both cell deaths. We have created a model of necroptosis (SL effect) and apoptosis (CXP effect). Using this model and inhibitors of key regulators of apoptosis and necroptosis and cells with knockout genes for these regulators, we will attempt to find the molecules responsible for the activation, progression, and linkage of each PCD. Morphological and biochemical features and differences in gene expression that are characteristic of each PCD will be investigated.

At least 54 RTKs exist in humans, which respond to extracellular signals delivered by more than 100 different ligands. As most cells are exposed to many diverse stimuli at the same time, specific intracellular mechanisms (patterns) of RTK signaling must exist, allowing cells to accurately respond to their environment. Accurate characterization of such patterns remains a major challenge of modern biology. Our previous research demonstrates that distinct, RTK-specific signaling patterns can be defined using current methodologies. We will integrate biochemistry, genetics and cell biology to obtain detailed characterization of signaling patterns of all human RTK´s. Comparison of given RTK´s signaling in the context of an entire RTK family will allow for identification of key features determining the signaling pattern specific to each RTK. This will improve our basic understanding of RTK signaling, and aid development of novel treatment strategies for cancer and other diseases caused by RTK deregulation.

The germ layers give rise to all types of body cells. How the germ layers form in the human embryo remains unclear. To elucidate the role of Activin signaling during early human embryonic stem cell (hESC) specialization, we use a hESC-derived developmental model that recapitulates early developmental stages in vivo. We find that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a newly discovered partner of the Activin pathway and that it determines development into mesentoderm or neuroectoderm. In the proposed project, we will identify target genes and expression profiles affected via PTP1B that determine future neural and mesentodermal fate. Furthermore, we will specify the cell type(s) derived from mesentodermal stem cells. This project aims to elucidate the role of Activin/ALK4/PTP1B signaling during germ layer fate decision making, which may shed light on how the germ layers of the human embryo are formed.

One of the biggest obstacles in production of pluripotent stem cells is adaptation of the cells to the culture conditions in vitro, accompanied by genome destabilization. Genome stability is also critical to the quality of germ cells. To protect the genomic stability, pluripotent cells as well as germ cells pose elevated BER and homologous recombination, while NHEJ remains constant. Such unique DNA repair setup can be found only in pluripotent stem cells and germ cells. While pluripotent stem cells downregulate BER during prolonged cultivation similar decrease in BER was observed in male germ cells during aging. The aim of the project is to verify the hypothesis that the pathway choice in BER rich pluripotent stem cells and germ cells affecting output error rate depends on the channeling of the base damage through BER mediated double stranded breaks to NHEJ, while the pluripotency controlling proteins cooperate on shielding the DNA ends from HR.

Although they are broadly characterized as ciliopathies, most of the SRPS result from unknown biologic mechanisms. Elucidation of these mechanisms provides an invaluable opportunity to understand the primary cilia function. The team of Deborah Krakow at the University of California in Los Angeles has recently defined several SRPS genes in a cohort of 150 cases collected over the last 30 years. The team of Pavel Krejci at Masaryk University has developed novel experimental approaches to study the primary cilia, particularly focused on the skeleton. This project proposes a unique collaboration between two complementary teams to elucidate novel mechanisms in SRPS pathology.

56747;1416/2016;Interactive guide to the preparation of final theses at LF MU;Karolyi Matěj, Mgr.;117307;Příjemce;LF;Inst.biostatistiky a analýz;Schizophrenia affects over 1% of the population worldwide and is a multifactorial disorder, which is caused by genetic, non-genetic (epigenetic), and environmental factors. Schizophrenia is a condition with altered brain morphology, connectivity, and function. This disorder has no cure and is the most frequent cause of morbidity, disability, and impairment of individual quality of life and well-being. Substantial progress has been made in the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. However, modern antipsychotic medication is still associated with side effects, poor compliance, drug discontinuation, and low efficacy on negative and cognitive symptoms. The inaccessibility of brain cells to evaluate the cellular neuropathology and its changes in the context of clinical or treatment data of living patients is a major obstacle in understanding disease development and the progress of effective treatment. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology renders a breakthrough to convert skin cells, or other cell types, into brain cells (e.g., neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), whereby patient-specific brain cells can be structured in a 2D or a 3D system that mimics neural networks in the brain. This project is to employ iPSC technology with multifaceted approaches, which include biology (consisting of stem cell biology, neurobiology, genetics, and epigenetics), medicine, mathematics, and computational systems to establish a therapeutic platform for individual patients. The platform amalgams an in-vitro iPSC-based schizophrenia model system with in-vivo approaches (MRI imaging, EEG, and behavioural observations) to delineate the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the actions of antipsychotic drugs at multiple levels from molecule, cell, brain, to behaviour. The outcome of drug assessments for individual patients will be the basis for clinical trial in tailored treatment.

MUDr. Ph.D.;24010;Příjemce;LF;Ústav patologie;"Cardiac arrhythmias are a major part of heart diseases and defects, the same time cardiovascular diseases represent the leading cause of death in developed world. They include not only cellular based malfunction, most often ion mishandling or organelle defects, such as channelopathies or mitochondrial diseases, but also whole organ impairment such as sinus node diseases. Many of these defects can be corrected to certain degree by symptomatic treatment. However the molecular basis of arrhythmias remains to be treated by future cell replacement therapies. Conventional anti-bradyarrhythmic strategies such as implantation of electronic pacemakers must deal with potential infections, limited battery life and invasive implantation of leads. Although there have been technical improvements, these strategies still lack neurohumoral reactivity. The aim of the present research project is to exploit recent advances in stem cell research and genetic engineering, to develop patient specific cell based strategies in order to fabricate a ""biopacemaker"" that overcomes the drawbacks of an artificial machine. Channelopathies leading to either arrhythmias or other heart defects will be modelled in vitro using patient specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to uncover the molecular basis of the disease phenotype and to screen for novel drugs. Human fibroblasts and iPSC overexpressing specific channels (e.g. RyR, HCN, KCN, SERCA families etc) either wild type or harbouring patient specific mutations will serve as both the tool to investigate the diseased phenotype and as a ""biopacemaker"" (BPM) both in vitro and in vivo. Novel system based on the xenograft models in immunodeficient animals will be designed for the assessment of safety to the use of human pluripotent stem cell based tools. Safety of introduced cellular components will be optimized by elimination of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells and alternatively using other patient specific adult cells. Optimal cardiac cell sub-type and stage of cardiac cell development will be evaluated by evaluating expression of cardiac proteins, mitochondrial and cellular metabolisms and performing functional studies such as intracellular calcium measurements, electrophysiology and mechano-biological measurements. Finally the resulting cardiomyocytes will serve as Biopacemaker (BP) in vitro and in vivo."

The complexity of KB research and the development of their biomedical applications thus raises the need for coordinated action on a unifying expert platform. Such platforms, virtual or physical, have existed for years in most European countries, but the Czech Republic lacks such a platform. This fact represents a major obstacle to progress in this highly important interdisciplinary sector in the Czech Republic. Moreover, this absence disqualifies the Czech Republic from participating in international research projects and accessing international financial support. In order to overcome these serious limitations, we propose to create and develop a unique research infrastructure - ""Infrastructure for the use of stem cells in biomedicine"" (InfraStem). This research infrastructure (VI) will be primarily based on the experience and resources gained from many years of development in three major scientific institutions in the Czech Republic: the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the CAS (Prague), the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University (Brno) and the 2nd Faculty of Medicine of Charles University (Prague). The instrumentation, cellular resources and all the knowledge will be available through this VI to a wide range of users, from biologists to legislators to the biotechnology industry. The key positives that this VI will bring will be in particular: (i) more efficient use of the innovation potential and human resources of research teams and institutions, leading to increased competitiveness in all areas of application of the KB; (ii) strengthening interdisciplinary research by linking different fields such as KB biology, bio/nanomaterials and advanced imaging; (iii) creating an environment stimulating the creation of scientific research networks, through joint access to unique instruments, methodologies, cosultations and science education, iv) strengthening collaboration with partners from the application sector such as hospitals and small and medium-sized companies, v) enhancing the quality of multi-level education with a positive impact on R&D careers, vi) creating an independent expert level overseeing safety and legislative/eti"

The national infrastructure CZECRIN is formed under the leadership of Masaryk University as a beneficiary and St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno (FNUSA) as another participant in the project. The essence of the CZECRIN infrastructure is close cooperation between academic, research and clinical institutions, which is reflected in the organisation and organisational structure. The basic building units are the University and Clinical Modules. The University Module manages methodological support, coordination and independent monitoring of clinical trials, collection, storage and analysis of clinical data and education in the field of clinical trials, at the same time it is the carrier of research activities in the subject area. Masaryk University is the national contact point with a link to the international ECRIN-ERIC consortium. The University module is synergistically complemented by the Clinical module, which is methodologically managed by FNUSA, whose key function is the identification of patients fulfilling the criteria of clinical trials, with special attention to less early diagnoses requiring broad cooperation of medical institutions. Another function of the Clinical Module is the implementation of clinical trial standards in the legislative context of the Czech Republic and the practical implementation of clinical trials. The two modules together ensure interaction with the regulatory authorities of the Czech Republic. The infrastructure thus covers the whole Czech Republic and is able to provide preparatory, implementation and control activities in the conduct of academic clinical trials and clinical trials in theory at any stage and of any expertise. The national contact point of the CZECRIN infrastructure for foreign countries is Masaryk University, through the Institute of Pharmacology of the Faculty of Medicine, with a link to the international ECRIN-ERIC consortium.

Our research question was both simple and essential - do these cells need a centrosome, and if so, for what?  Our results, obtained by combining several molecular biology approaches, revealed the absolute necessity of the centrosome for self-renewal of human pluripotent cells (i.e. for the maintenance of pluripotency), but not for cell division per se. Subsequent experiments showed that the molecular basis of the phenomenon we discovered is prolonged mitosis time and changes in the metabolism of proteins crucial for pluripotency and differentiation (p53, Oct4, Nanog).

The objective of oncogenetics is to understand genetic predisposition to cancers and care for persons at risk. Genetic predispositions are often associated with a family history of cancer. However, cancers are very common and family histories exist, so a family history of cancer is not synonymous with a genetic predisposition. The purpose of a genetic consultation is to determine the share of family history and possible predisposition. Genetic tests, stills seldom practiced, sometimes confirm a hereditary origin. If an alteration is identified in a family, it can be sought in its relationships. This makes it possible to reassure those having no predisposition and following up those at risk.

The development of the mammary gland is unique in that it occurs largely postnatally and involves significant repetitive cyclical changes in epithelial structure during pregnancy, lactation and involution, when changes in the expression of female sex hormones cause proliferation or apoptosis of epithelial cells. These processes require precise temporal and spatial regulation by multiple signaling pathways, including signaling through fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). FGF signaling drives branching epithelial morphogenesis and regulates mammary stem cell activity.

MUDr. Ph.D.;141920;Příjemce;LF;Klinika dětské ORL;Despite the increasing number of new antiepileptic drugs, pharmacological treatment of childhood epilepsy is effective, i.e. leads to long-term suppression of epileptic seizures in approximately 70-80% of cases. We refer to the remaining 20-30% as pharmacoresistant epilepsies. According to the current consensus, pharmacoresistance is defined as the failure of two well-tolerated and appropriately chosen antiepileptic drugs (1). When pharmacoresistance criteria are met, non-pharmacological treatment options should always be considered - resectional epilepsy surgery in the first instance, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or ketogenic diet (KD) in the second instance. Early indication of non-pharmacological procedures (especially resection procedures with curative intent) is nowadays highly emphasized, yet many patients arrive at epileptology centres late or are not aware of these treatment options at all. Therefore, the primary goal of our project is to find suitable candidates for non-pharmacological treatment, individualized education of these patients (or parents) about the benefits of the above mentioned procedures and then their implementation.

In particular, the distribution of these substances in the bloodstream and thus visualize the blood supply to different parts of the body. The authors see the main use of ""fluorescent-guided surgery"" in the evaluation of blood supply to the ends of the intestine after removal of the pathologically altered part of the gastrointestinal tract and during its further connection. Poor blood supply at the site of connection of these ends can mean incomplete or no healing of the newly formed intestinal anastomosis, its disintegration and direct threat to the patient and life by complications both immediate and late, for example, by delaying further oncological treatment, which is necessary for some patients. The project is primarily a direct experiment, where the fluorescence technique will be used by the surgeon directly in the operating room during a resection procedure on the gastrointestinal tract. The main purpose of this technique will be to assess the blood supply to the bowel before sewing the ends of the bowel together and to determine the most inappropriate place to do so. Also, new directions and procedures will be sought in which the appropriateness of fluorescence is assumed - imaging of vascular structures during bowel preparation, illumination of lung segment margins during anatomical resections or detection of lymph nodes during tumor resections. This technique is not unknown in Western countries, where it has earned its firm place in the most important workplaces. Therefore, we consider the introduction of this technique into the routine surgical practice at our department to be very important."

55609;0720/2016;Protein profiling of liquid niche of the bone marrow microenvironment - the starting point of extramedullary relapse of multiple myeloma?;Ševčíková Sabina, doc. RNDr. Ph.D.;18245;Příjemce;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;Severely burned patients develop extensive post-traumatic oxidative stress after trauma. It is well known that the intensity of oxidative stress depends on the severity of thermal injury and also on the antioxidant status of the organism, but no biochemical parameters (markers of oxidative stress) related to the likelihood of developing infectious complications have been defined yet. Another concomitant of thermal trauma is the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with subsequent manifestations of immunodeficiency, which is also one of the causes of increased susceptibility to infections. The aim of our project is to find associations between markers of oxidative stress and the development of immunodeficiency and infection in severely and critically burned patients, which would allow individualization of microbiological investigations during treatment based on the determination of biochemical parameters of oxidative stress. The time course of oxidative stress in a group of critically burned patients will be monitored by measuring 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adducts and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BALS) samples as markers of lipid peroxidation and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in urine as a marker of total oxidative DNA damage. In addition, plasma antioxidant capacity (FRAP), low molecular weight thiols and vitamins E and A concentrations will be monitored to assess plasma antioxidant status. DNA damage will be monitored in the leukocyte fraction by comet assay. The severity of thermal trauma will be assessed by the abbreviated burn severity index (ABSI).In addition to basic data (age, sex, BMI, skin type, comorbidities, delay of therapy in hours), the presence of inhalation trauma, the development of SIRS, infectious complications and routine haematological and immunological investigations will be monitored. The data monitoring the development of oxidative stress will be compared with the analysis of inflammatory markers - CRP, PCT and commonly used markers of immunodeficiency and inflammation (CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio). Using the obtained results we will try to stratify patients into groups according to the given parameters and use statistical methods to find the group of patients who benefit most from the application of antimicrobial and antioxidant therapy.

MUDr. Ph.D.;24063;Partner;LF;Farmakologický ústav;"The project is based on the long-term professional focus of the Department of Paediatric Oncology of the Faculty of Medicine, evidenced by relevant publications. It continues and further develops the current project MUNI/A/1417/2015. The aim is to further develop the theranostic approach in children with refractory and relapsed solid tumours and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Our analyses of tumor tissue include detection of receptor kinase and MAP kinase phosphorylation by proteomic methods and next generation sequencing (NGS) by TruSight Tumor panel, Illumina. Based on analyses to date, personalized therapy (""biomarker-driven molecularly-targeted metronomic therapy"") has been applied in approximately 20% of cases. Since 2016, we have also introduced whole exome sequencing and transcriptional profiling into the comprehensive panel. Pilot observations show that the best therapeutic response with the theranostic approach is achieved in patients with concordant genomic, transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic data. Our proposed comprehensive development of tumor tissue investigation in children with refractory and relapsed solid tumors and NHL by an expanded panel of investigations (histopathology, NGS - TruSight, NGS - whole exome sequencing, transcriptional profiling, phosphoproteomic techniques), together with bioinformatics support, will lead to a deepening of our knowledge of the molecular profile of the tumor and the genetic background of the host (germline mutation carriage). We reasonably expect that downstream clinical application of this innovative theranostic approach will lead to more effective personalized treatment design (n=1 trials) in a significant percentage of children with refractory malignancies."

55432;0690/2016;Cisplatin-induced cardiovascular toxicity in children and young adults with germ cell tumours;Nováková Zuzana, MUDr. Ph.D.;2702;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Fyziologický ústav;RNA editing is one of the key steps in the expression of genetic information, during which introns are removed and adjacent exons are joined. This process depends not only on the recognition of the splice sites themselves, but also on the presence of exon and intron regulatory elements, whose disruption by mutations can significantly affect the success of splicing of pre-mRNA into mature mRNA. Intron mutations tend to be neglected especially in the field of hereditary disease diagnostics. The aim of this project is to investigate the extent to which intron mutations may be responsible for the disruption of the splicing process itself, focusing on the splicing of the pre-mRNA of the SERPING1 gene and the subsequent development of hereditary angioedema (HAE). In a subset of HAE patients, no causal mutation in any exon of the SERPING1 gene was found, although reduced plasma levels of the protein were detected. Intron mutations are possible candidates for causal mutations. Since the effect of distant intron mutations is not clearly predictable, the effect of such mutations will be experimentally verified. This will be done using a unique method developed previously at CEITEC MU, which allows to monitor the effect of a large number of mutations of the target gene in a single experiment using next-generation sequencing. The method itself has been developed and tested on exon mutations, however, its main advantage lies in verifying the effect of nucleotide substitutions that are not included in the resulting transcripts as is the case with intron mutations. This untapped approach to the problem will require both the resolution of partial methodological specificities and the development of bionformat tools for the analysis of sequencing data and their interpretation in the context of HAE development in patients. The use of this approach would be unique in addressing both general sequencing-related issues and medical diagnostics. The collaboration of CEITEC , LF and FI MU will allow for more extensive analyses of the impact of intron mutations, which were not possible before, both in the context of real HAE diagnosis and with respect to general knowledge regarding intron regulators of splicing.

PharmDr. Ph.D.;14537;Partner;LF;Farmakologický ústav;Homologous recombination (HR) is an essential mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks and damaged replication forks and is associated with a wide range of genetic diseases, cancer and premature aging. A key factor in this process is the formation of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, which is able to locate homologous DNA and mediate its copying. To ensure the timely and correct completion of this process, HR must be regulated. Among its regulators are DNA helicases, which protect the genome from aberrant HR by being able to degrade the RAD51 strand and possibly other recombination intermediates. However, very little is known about how these regulators function at the molecular level. In this project, we will use revolutionary technologies to study biochemical porcesses in real time, both in mixture and at the single-molecule level. Determining the mechanism of HR regulation will improve our understanding of the molecular basis of carcinogenesis and may present a unique opportunity for therapeutic applications.

In hospitalised patients, attention will be paid to the rate of return of the elderly's level of self-sufficiency depending on the intensity of rehabilitation. In the coming year, the project is also devoted to various directions of long-term prevention of multimorbidity as a factor significantly accelerating the development of dependence of the elderly and the deterioration of their quality of life. One of the complex factors is vitamin D, whose low level influences, among other things, the sensitivity of tissues to insulin and thus the state of diabetes compensation, including the development of chronic complications of diabetes.   Pharmacotherapy and especially compliance and adherence are also significant risks for loss of self-sufficiency. On the other hand, attention must be paid to over-the-counter medications, especially steroids, because of their numerous adverse side effects.

The whole concept is based on the interaction of a rare earth metal labelled antibody (Ab) (Ln-Ab) with its antigen (Ag), which in this case will be selected proteins related to metal metabolism in prostate cancer. The resulting antibody-antigen complex (Ln-Ab-Ag) will then be imaged by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Each antibody will be labelled with a different lanthanide (e.g. La, Ce, Eu, Gd, ...), thus allowing the development of a versatile method that allows simultaneous imaging of a wide range of analytes in the sample. The advantage of this method of antibody labeling and detection will be the possibility of determining a wide range of different proteins or other antigens, as well as the possibility of localizing them both in relation to each other and in the context of the tissue.

MUDr. CSc.;122;Příjemce;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative brain disease after Alzheimer's disease. The prevalence of PN is generally estimated to be 0.3% in the general population and 1% in the population over 60 years of age. The incidence of PN is then 8-18 new cases per 100,000 population each year. A significant increase in incidence occurs after the age of 60. Apart from the characteristic progressive motor disability, PN is often accompanied by psychological changes. Cognitive impairment affects up to 90% of patients, and already in the early stages of PN, 20-25% of patients have objective cognitive deficits that meet the criteria for mild cognitive impairment in PN (MCI). The presence of MCI is a risk factor for the development of dementia in PN. The most common cognitive deficits in early-stage PN include the dysexecutive syndrome and visual information processing disorders. Despite considerable research in this area, the neurobiological mechanisms leading to cognitive impairment in PN patients are still not well understood. Dementia in PN has a negative impact on the patient's self-sufficiency, social and occupational quality of life for the patient and caregiver and is associated with a significant increase in morbidity/mortality. Therefore, early identification of patients at risk of developing FCP and dementia in PN is an important priority.

The previous project resulted in the validation of behavioral paradigms for testing mental functions and their disorders in healthy population and piloting the paradigms in patients with mental disorders. Four behavioral tests of impulsivity were validated, the use of the tests together with fMRI and EEG was initiated, and individually targeted neuronavigation for the treatment of rTMS was piloted . In addition, a paradigm for mapping psychophysiological correlates of emotion regulation was validated in a healthy population and testing of patients with eating disorders was initiated. Finally, a social cognition test distinguishing between affective and cognitive theories of mind was validated and implemented for use with fMRI. In the follow-up project, the Psychiatric Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine and Medical Faculty of the University of Medical Sciences in Brno will mainly measure impulsivity using EEG and fMRI in patients with borderline personality disorder, ADHD and Parkinson's disease, measure emotional regulation using ECG monitoring, respiration and skin conductance in patients with eating disorders and measure social cognition using fMRI in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the Psychiatric Clinic is developing methods of neuronavigation and treatment using rTMS. Research on this treatment method is currently underway in patients with schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder and ADHD, and treatment of hospitalized patients with depressive symptoms is also underway. The aim of the project is to obtain the first results from mapping the neural and psychophysiological correlates of given psychological functions in selected groups of patients and to implement the results for individually targeted therapies.

They usually have a rapid and aggressive course and affect not only the patient's life but also the life of those around him. The most important goal of care for these individuals is therefore to cure the disease completely (if possible) or at least to achieve a long-term remission so that the patient can return to normal life. It is therefore necessary not only to recognise the disease early, but also to diagnose it accurately and administer high-quality therapy. A great promise is the introduction of so-called personalised medicine, which allows the patient to tailor treatment to his or her needs, including minimising side effects, while comprehensively assessing the various factors influencing the effect of the therapy in question. Infectious complications are very often part of the treatment - they are even a more common cause of death than the disease itself. Therefore, in order to avoid an imminent threat to the patient's life, it is essential to identify the infectious agent early and correctly and to start an appropriate and effective treatment.

These disorders affect more than 5% of the human population worldwide. Psychiatric illnesses represent a significant and growing socio-economic burden on European populations. Although the development of psychopharmaceuticals has led to significant improvements in the treatment of the most severe disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and major depressive disorder, the effectiveness of treatment is limited. The initiative for bilateral collaboration between Czech and Norwegian scientists brings together the teams of Assoc. Wadeley, as project proponent, and Prof. Glover, as project partner. The scientific team of doc. Wadeley is interested in finding out what causes the devastating psychological states in schizophrenia. Her team has generated neurons from specific patients suffering from schizophrenia using state-of-the-art technology called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Neurons are key brain cells that trigger our thinking and behaviour. The next step in the project is to understand why neurons behave abnormally in schizophrenic patients. Prof. Glover's research team has expertise in how neurons communicate with each other at the molecular and cellular level. They also have expertise in stem cell culture. Our proposed bilateral project aims to develop a comprehensive platform of complementary techniques to assess communication between neural circuits and neurons derived from induced stem cells in schizophrenic patients. The outcomes of the bilateral initiative are as follows: 3 phd students and 1-2 junior postdoc scientists will be involved in the bilateral training required to: 1) set up and use the neuron-to-neuron communication platform; 2) gain the practical knowledge required to apply neurodifferentiation protocols; 3) directly compare the different platforms in terms of advantages for speed, throughput, drug compatibility, and potential for cross-application; and 4) transfer knowledge, share experiences, skills, and best practices."

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this phenomenon remain poorly characterized. An absence of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged FGFR3-ERK signaling complicates understanding of the pathology of achondroplasia and other related conditions, and compromises development of a treatment for these debilitating human diseases.

MUDr. Ph.D.;2002;Partner;LF;I. neurologická klinika; Our previous work at the field, and preliminary experiments carried out for this proposal, point to complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels and may contribute to prolonged ERK activation by FGFR3. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR3 expression, FGFR3 interactions with its downstream signaling mediators, processes governing active FGFR3 turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR3-ERK signal. In this proposal, we will use mathematical modeling to reconstruct, for the first time, the molecular networks mediating FGFR3-ERK activation and to predict their behavior. The in silico simulations of FGFR3 signal transduction processes will aid biological experiments to confirm the predicted systems behavior and to identify important molecular switches and regulators. These will be experimentally targeted in cell models to pathological FGFR3 signaling.

Medicine as a science generally considers healing to be ineffective and partially dangerous. State policy towards healing is then a mixture of tolerance, restriction and acceptance. In the Czech Republic, however, legal uncertainty, due to ignorance and disorientation, prevails. Healing is a socially significant phenomenon that has causes and manifestations. It is part of an unofficial and illegal economy. Healing must be taken into account by doctors and other health professionals because some of their patients use it and many consider it.

Its subject will not be the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of specific healing practices and products for the treatment of specific patients. Such research would be conducted in hospitals. Nevertheless, the investigators will include a physician, Dr. Halámková (Masaryk Cancer Institute), and a nutritionist, Dr. Peřina, as it is desirable to investigate the actions and thinking of patients suffering from serious illness and specific diseases and the marketing of healing products and their safety. Medicine and attitudes towards it will be examined as an ethical dilemma, which will be taken up by medical ethicist Assoc. Chicken. Regulation will be explored by institutional lawyer and health law educator Dr. Koscik. Civil law educator doc. Selucká and PhD student Mgr. Pavelek, as well as the teacher of European Union law and health law doc. Křepelka, who will be the project leader, will research private and public law aspects of medical regulation, including the impact of international and European integration.

The efficacy of TKIs shows clinically significant variability and may be time-limited with subsequent development of secondary resistance. Using therapeutic drug monitoring methods and analysis of genetic information and epigenetic processes in patients, the correlation of these factors with response to treatment will be evaluated. The results of the studies should contribute to personalise the dosage of TKIs, thus increasing their clinical efficacy or reducing toxic effects.

Attractive as this concept is, its implementation is conditioned by many facts that go beyond biology. Of particular importance are the following two: a) the availability of non-cellular carrier materials that will support normal cell behaviour, in particular cell division, differentiation and 3D organisation into typical morphological structures; b) the demonstration that tissue engineering is an approach that has the potential to be scalable in terms of economic cost and effect on human (societal) health. This project builds on the unique expertise existing at five MU departments, which gives the opportunity to adequately study and develop the above aspects of tissue engineering. The first aspect, carrier development, will use a combination of polymer wetting and 3D deposition and their plasmochemical modification with functional groups, followed by iterative comprehensive testing of their properties in in vitro systems with cells. An important feature will be that the cells used will be normal human stem and progenitor cells with relevant clinical potential. The second aspect, socio-economic calculation, will use information on the cost of research, development and implementation of possible tissue engineering-based medical and biotechnological approaches. The estimated effects of the results achieved will serve as input for the elaboration of model-based economic cost-effectiveness analyses. The experience gained will result in the formulation of methodological recommendations for refinement of the cost-effectiveness assessment methodology in the field of tissue engineering. Thus, in its entirety, the solution of the presented project will provide theoretical knowledge on the interaction of innovative materials with medically attractive cell types, develop standardized protocols for the preparation of these materials, create a basis for further development of these materials towards their biomedical application and set socio-economic parameters guaranteeing efficiency in this area of development."

There is currently a renaissance in the use of thermal imaging cameras in clinical practice. The essential reason is the increasing technical quality of the devices, but also the resolution and sensitivity of the resulting images - thermograms. Thermal imaging has already proven itself in the past as a suitable diagnostic tool for monitoring the quality and state of blood circulation in the lower limbs of patients. It is the degree of blood supply that plays a significant role in the surgeon's decision making in determining the correct colonic resection line and subsequent determination of the anastomosis site.

The thermal camera should determine the degree of blood supply to the colon and help to visualize individual angiosomes during the resection procedure. Patients will be thermographically examined in FB Brno during the surgical procedure. Subsequent evaluation of the images will then take place at the Biophysical Institute of the Faculty of Medicine. The specificity of the project is due to the direct cooperation between the clinical and theoretical workplace, where the surgeon determines the appropriate surgical procedure based on subjective evaluation, and the thermal imaging camera will provide an additional useful angle of view during the surgical procedure. The proposed project is based on the experience of previous studies carried out, where surface temperature proved to be a suitable indicator of tissue blood supply.

The main aim of the current project is to study the changes of zonulae occludentes (ZO) tight junctions and their effect on blood-lymphatic barrier (HLB) permeability in the laboratory rat after pharmacologically induced peripheral neuropathy by administration of the taxane class chemotherapeutic Paclitaxel.
53748;0107/2016;University-Industry Educational Centre in Advanced Biomedical and Medical Informatics;Bourek Aleš, MUDr. Ph.D.;1062;Partner;LF;Biofyzikální ústav; One of the side effects of taxanes is the development of peripheral neuropathy, which results from a disturbance in calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial damage in peripheral nerve axons. In experimental laboratory rat models, it has been found that Paclitaxel administration triggers an inflammatory response in the spinal ganglia, spinal cord and other structures of the central nervous system. Similar changes also occur in chronic nerve injury characterized by induction of satellite glial cell activation, invasion of activated macrophages, microglia proliferation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. The spread of the inflammatory response to the various stages of the central nervous system may be via the blood and/or the liquor. Our earlier experiments demonstrated the penetration of labeled dextran from blood and liquor into the spinal ganglion, demonstrating the permeability of the blood-nerve and liquor-nerve barriers to cytokine-sized molecules. We also found that peripheral nerve injury induces cellular changes and increased HLB permeability in the plexus choroideus (CP) of the cerebral ventricles.

It is known that changes in TLR9 can affect the tightness of ZO-type junctions. We hypothesize that taxanes may act on ZO proteins in the HLB by signaling through TLR9, thereby affecting the permeability of the blood-lymphatic barrier to cytokine-sized molecules.

These microorganisms pose a significant risk to patients with compromised immunity. The rapid and reliable identification of these microorganisms and the monitoring of their clonality, as well as the demonstration of the presence of virulence factors, are crucial for the implementation of effective preventive measures and the choice of appropriate therapeutic approaches. The project addresses comprehensively the issue of diagnosis of nosocomial infections caused by these microorganisms, with emphasis on optimisation of diagnostic schemes as well as the design and validation of new identification and typing methods, including molecular biology techniques and methods based on capillary electrophoresis, Raman spectrometry and mass spectrometry. The clinical relevance of the agents under investigation will also be assessed by monitoring their prevalence and demonstrating the presence of virulence factors and biofilm formation. The project also includes the search for new preventive and therapeutic approaches for these infections, in particular the use of antimicrobial agents effective against microbial biofilms, or antibacterial surfaces of medical devices. New antimicrobial agents, in particular bacteriophages, will also be tested.

In previous years, extensive research has been conducted on the process of assessing non-healing wounds in clinical practice (in acute inpatient care, home care and social service settings).   Based on the analysis of the outcomes of previous projects, gaps were identified not only in the assessment of non-healing wounds, but in particular in the lack of erudition of non-medical direct care workers in wound management and in identifying the risk of decubitus lesions. The quality of care for people with non-healing wounds has been assessed within the framework of JRC projects, but the issue of assessing the psychometric properties of assessment tools has not yet been addressed in the Czech Republic. This paper is thus one of the first of its kind. The project should enable further improvement of the quality of care using foreign experience (especially the work of Prof. M. Ahtial from Finland and the validation of the scale for assessing the risk of decubitus) and its implementation. Particular attention will be paid to the identification of patients at risk of developing decubitus in intensive care and to the assessment of inter-rater reliability of individual tools. This is an intervention project. The project activities build on the professional activities of the project co-proposer (member of the committee of the Czech Society for Wound Management - CSWM, member of the committee of the European Wound Management Association - EWMA) and contacts with the Finnish researcher Prof. Maarit Ahtiala. The aim of the project is to improve the professional competences of general nurses in wound management in intensive care. The project is designed as a multidimensional one, linking specific areas of wound management - prevention and diagnosis of pressure ulcers. It also changes the perspective on the identification of lesion risk. The basis of the process of effective care is the correct determination of risk, followed by diagnosis and appropriate treatment - naming and epidemiological assessment of the phenomenon. Based on the project activities, it will be possible to collect relevant data, to perform clinical and population (epidemiological) assessment in a specific health care facility, to plan and implement educational activities for health care professionals in direct care and to increase the knowledge and skills of health care professionals.

For better illustration, the molecule FGF21 has been selected, which is a protein with high potential in health care and therapy of selected diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and related cardiovascular diseases). However, an important limitation for the practical use of FGF21 is its extremely low stability and relatively high cost of production. As it is a relatively new protein whose properties have been described relatively recently, no clear idea has yet been established about the future route of administration to patients. The task of the ESF and LF investigators will be to map the needs of the target markets and the interest of potential consumers in terms of final administration. This information will help the FF to better plan research in the areas of stabilisation, production, and possibly immobilisation, so as to achieve modification of the molecule in line with the end use in practice. The CTT will provide the research team with effective legal and other support towards industrial-law (or other required) protection. This will mitigate the risk of dead-end development branches and will allow the FP to develop a stable FGF21 molecule tailored directly to the needs and purposes mentioned. Work on patent protection will be initiated in due course, eliminating the risk of leakage of confidential information. As a result, the potential for transfer of the researched and innovated product into practice will be greatly enhanced. The concept proposed during the project will be as universal as possible, i.e. applicable to different types of applied research projects. This will ensure that the funds spent on applied research will be used efficiently and directly in relation to what the market and consumer demand. This procedure in the form of transfer of basic research to applied research is still missing at Masaryk University.

Mainly, the objective is to study the effect of the trans-phosphorylation, implicating a transactivation between unrelated RTKs that phosphorylated each other, characterizing novel unknown transactivations among human RTKs. Together with the identification of new transactivations, the objective is to determine the underlying molecular pathways of the process and to establish the functional consequences of transactivations for mechanisms RTK signaling in cells. Via systematic approaches combining novel tools developed for this project with methods of modern biochemistry, genetics and cell biology, we will determine the transactivation properties for all human RTKs.

MUDr. CSc.;1007;Příjemce;LF;Ústav veřejného zdraví;In the Czech Republic, 600 to 1200 children with moderate hearing loss and 100 children with very severe hearing loss are diagnosed each year. Hearing defects affect 1:1000 physiological newborns and 20-40:1000 pathological newborns. Compared to other childhood diseases that are picked up by full-body screening, such as phenylketonuria (1:4500 newborns) or hypothyroidism (1:4000 newborns), this is a very common disability with far-reaching consequences. Up to 60% of hearing defects are congenital, occurring during the first trimester of pregnancy, and 40% are acquired. A child with a hearing loss is at risk of delayed psychomotor development, limited learning ability, difficulties in integrating into society, and problems in entering the labour market later in life. Modern medicine is constantly looking for ways to adequately rehabilitate hearing. The aim of the project is to monitor the effectiveness and compare different options of hearing rehabilitation (cochlear implants, hearing aids, BAHA, middle ear implants) in children of different ages and with different types of hearing loss.

MUDr. Ph.D., MBA;152;Příjemce;LF;Neurochirurgická klinika; Our know-how is based on the specific and selective inhibition of XPF/ERCC1 nuclease. This complex is involved in the repair of damaged DNA within the nucleotide excision repair pathway, repair of interstrand junctions (caused e.g. by cisplatin treatment) and repair of double-strand breaks (caused e.g. by irradiation) in DNA by homologous recombination. Defects in individual proteins of this complex are associated with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne (CS) syndromes. It has been described that XPF/ERCC1 is required for the repair of a number of therapeutic agents including cisplatin. As a consequence, high levels of this complex have been associated with a poor prognosis of response to chemotherapeutic treatment in a number of cancers (e.g., ovarian cancer, non-small cell carcinoma, melanoma), thus predisposing inhibitors of this nuclease to clinical applications. Finally, it has also been described that inhibition of XPF/ERCC1 leads to specific synthetic lethality along with inhibition of ATR and PARP. This principle represents a revolutionary and unique pharmacological target for genetically defined tumor types.

By appropriate inhibition or activation of these proteins by drugs, pathological processes could be inhibited or desired processes could be promoted. However, the development of such drugs is very costly because the investigational substance must pass through all phases of laboratory and clinical testing to determine its pharmacokinetics, toxicity and specificity. However, it is rarely possible to develop a specific, non-toxic inhibitor of a given mutant form of a particular kinase. Thus, there are many chemicals that have not proven to be specific inhibitors of a particular kinase, and for which much money has already been invested in their development. and other drugs whose development has been halted at various stages because, of the entire family of tyrosine kinases, the drug needs to target only one particular enzyme or only one mutant form of that enzyme. Because RTK signaling is involved in controlling cell proliferation and migration, mutations in RTKs often manifest themselves in the development of cancerous tumors. Testing the specificity of a therapeutic under development is a key step in its development, verifying the effect of a given chemical on the activity of the targeted kinase as well as on the activity of related enzymes in different cell types. Our laboratory has developed a plasmid library of 331 RTK receptors and their mutants that have been associated with more than 50 human diseases. This set in its breadth represents a globally unique set of all receptor kinases on which the specificity of potential therapeutics can be tested. We have also developed a luciferase reporter to read out the activity of one RTK signaling pathway, the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway. Since almost all RTKs signal in the same way, it is likely that this reporter will detect the activity of other RTKs as well. The aim of the project is to modify the existing FGF reporter to be able to read the activity of all RTK receptors and to introduce specificity testing of RTK inhibitors using the reporter and the RTK library.

The consortium is featured by a geographic and thematic focus which will benefit the project implementation in a multiplicity of ways. Medical Studies have become a preferred choice for many women interested to enter scientific professions both in terms of research careers and medical practice as such. Still, gender gaps are visible in terms of vertical segregation and access to top positions (SheFigures, 2015) as well as horizontally within medical specialties. Overall, GEPinMED will allow to dig deep into the many different facets of gender inequalities beyond the most simplistic identifications of the issue with quantitative presence of women in top positions: gender structural inequalities and gender stereotypes embed cultural and organizational structures in many subtle and sometime less visible ways, through organizational cultures not recognizing the care related roles any person (male and female) shall combine with employment and career, biased performance evaluation in recruitment and promotion practices, positioning women into certain sub-disciplines for gender biased considerations, often pursuing gender neutral and gender blind research methods also when it is blatant that sex shall be taken as a crucial variable in research, such as it is the case for studying pathologies symptoms and effects of treatments on female and male patients. In addition, a very focused approach aiming at expanding gender structural change from the Faculty to the overall academic levels since the very beginning will be adopted.

However, as in other fields of medicine, a new paradigm of personalised medicine is gaining significant traction in rare diseases, where personalisation is defined as the use of both disease-specific and patient-specific characteristics. The range of applications of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) is expanding at a tremendous pace. The introduction of ATMPs into orphan disease therapies appears to be a very innovative and promising approach that needs to be validated in a clinical trial setting. Using the principles of personalised medicine, ATMPs, especially monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors, are used in the treatment of paediatric cancer patients. Childhood cancers can also be seen as rare diseases. However, ATMPs are only registered for the adult patient population and are thus used off-label in paediatric oncology. There is very little clinical evidence of dose correlation, therapeutic concentration or anti-tumour effect of these treatments in children. There is a complete lack of information on the issue of adverse effects of these drugs in paediatric cancer patients. In line with the scientific objectives of the FNUSA-ICRC Pediatric Oncology Translational Research (POTR) team, the project aims to monitor therapeutic concentrations and search for optimal biological response of the above mentioned drugs.

It uses a direct current product that causes permeabilization of the cell membrane in a short pulse, without thermal damage to the tissue. As a result, it has the potential to limit serious complications and improve the effectiveness of standard radiofrequency ablation (RFA). For two decades, IRE has been used in oncology, but has not yet been comprehensively tested in the treatment of arrhythmias. The targeting of energy to different cell types, and the process of point lesion formation in the atria and ventricles of the heart need to be elucidated. The associated safety profile and optimization of settings must be ensured. Cardiomyocyte clusters differentiated from stem cells will be used to elucidate the effect of IRE at the cellular level, and changes in cell subtypes and apoptosis rates will be analyzed in different pulse settings. New catheters will be modified and used for animal experiments and the IRE generator will be modified and supplemented with ECG synchronization. Selective ablations will be performed in porcine pulmonary vein ostia, atria and ventricles, and the effect of ablation on the conduction system and other tissues (esophagus, n. phrenicus) will be evaluated.

In these cases, heart transplantation may be the only possible solution. In the future, transplantation could be replaced by direct transdifferentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. However, the safety, specificity and efficacy of transdifferentiation must be addressed. In this project, we propose to develop and optimize a cardiac fibroblast transdifferentiation protocol based on local application of transdifferentiation factors and local reversible electroporation (RE) using a heart model generated from human pluripotent stem cells. We further plan to use the new protocol to improve and monitor long-term regeneration of a porcine model of myocardial infarction in situ by localizing transdifferentiation factors and RE energy to the affected site.

The prevalence of B-cell malignancies increases rapidly with increasing age, with an incidence of over 5% in adults over 60 years of age, representing a general public health problem. Affected patients remain for long periods without any treatment. The evolution of precancerous cells leads to a decline in immune surveillance and subsequent progression to multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Key molecules involved in immune cell changes will be identified using Genomic Expression Profiling. Selected biomarkers will be assessed for clinical use in cellular models. The identified general mechanisms of immune surveillance decline should provide the possibility of novel strategies to prevent pathological changes in the immune system and thus significantly prolong the precancerous stage.

Consequently, chemotherapy have an important role in the HNSCC. The key anticancer drug for advanced HNSCC is still cisplatin (CDDP). Nevertheless, not all cases have a good response to this drug and some tumours show resistance. CDDP administration in such cases would provide no curative effect but could increase adverse side effects. It would be of great clinical importance if tumour sensitivity to the drug could be predicted before its administration to patient. With a unique instrumental set-up (multimodal holographic microscopy, atomic-force microscopy, high throughput cell imaging, flow-cytometry) we will try to identify morphological and mechanical aspects of chemoresistance in primary cell cultures derived from tumour tissue of HNSCC patients. Main aim is to develop in vitro assay for routine pre-therapeutic assessment of CDDP resistance.

More than 50% of patients with CRC are diagnosed with liver metastases (liver metastases). Patients with synchronous metastases have worse survival outcomes. Surgical treatment is the only potentially curative treatment with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%. Less than 10% of patients with synchronous JMCC undergo liver resection. The traditional treatment approach (primary first approach) is to remove the primary tumour in the first instance and resect the metastases after systemic treatment. The disadvantage is the time delay from the diagnosis of JMCC to their resection. An initially resectable lesion may become unresectable. Simultaneous resection of the primary tumor and liver metastases is burdened with higher perioperative mortality. In the last decade, another approach has emerged with the intention of increasing the resectability of JMCC - liver first approach (LFA). In this case, neoadjuvant systemic therapy is followed by liver resection. This is followed by adjuvant systemic therapy and finally resection of the primary tumour. Randomized trials describing LFA and data with overall survival are lacking.

Ph.D.;19683;Příjemce;LF;Mikrobiologický ústav;A potential complication of angiosurgical procedures on the abdominal aorta is ischemia of intra-abdominal organs. Acute intestinal ischemia (acute mesenteric ischemia - AMI) is one of the most serious. The reported incidence of AMI after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) resection is 3% for elective and up to 60% for emergent procedures, with a mortality rate of up to 90%. Early detection of AMI is absolutely essential to initiate treatment while the condition is still reversible. Clinical diagnosis of AMI is very difficult, and there is no specific laboratory marker. Diagnostic imaging methods are limited by sensitivity and specificity. Angiography and colonoscopy are invasive, limited in availability and not always feasible. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and microRNA are new technologies potentially suitable for early diagnosis of AMI. Changes in the concentrations of these markers in response to ischemic insults have already been described for other organs. We believe that kinetic analysis of IMA and circulating microRNA concentrations allows monitoring of tissue ischemia after aortic reconstruction and potentially early diagnosis of AMI. Aims of the project:To describe the dynamics of IMA and microRNA concentrations after abdominal aortic procedures, correlate with conventional biomarkers, non-invasive imaging and clinical findings, and propose a prospective clinical trial design to validate the utility of these technologies for early diagnosis of AMI.

RNDr. Ph.D.;9447;Příjemce;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;Clear cell carcinoma is one of the most common renal cancers. These tumours are often pseudohypoxic and may therefore exhibit a number of changes in cellular homeostasis and metabolism. It is known that hypoxia modulates calcium transport and also that Ca2+ signaling pathways are remodeled or deregulated in tumors, and these changes in cellular physiology distinguish them from non-tumor tissue. This remodeling or deregulation of Ca2+ signaling pathways may represent a mechanism by which cancer cells resist systemic anti-tumor defense mechanisms. Thus, the aim of this project is to study changes in gene expression of Ca2+ transport systems in clear cell carcinoma samples compared to healthy kidney tissue. The physiological/pathophysiological consequences of these changes will be studied in vitro in RCC4 and CAKI1 stable cell lines, both derived from clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

A large proportion of women exhibiting certain clinical signs of preterm birth will, however, eventually deliver in term, while only a smaller proportion of pregnant women (mainly those with premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM)) inevitably delivers in a short time after first clinical presentation (< 7 days). Currently, no biomarkers are available to distinguish between women who will deliver < 7 days after clinical presentation/hospital admission for PTB and those who will deliver later. Adipokines are a family of proteins predominantly secreted by adipose tissue that play an important role in physiology as well as pathophysiology of pregnancy. Specific expression profiles in context of the genetic background as well as metabolic profiles thus may provide potential biomarkers of PTB. Further understanding of the mechanisms that involve adipokines during PTB development thus could provide novel theranostic strategies in PTB.

Despite considerable progress due to the introduction of therapy with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, which have significantly prolonged the survival interval, a large proportion of MM patients still relapse.  Much effort has also been devoted to the development of a panel of prognostic markers, but unfortunately none of them provides sufficiently accurate diagnostic and prognostic information and does not allow prediction of response to a specific treatment regimen. This project, through a unique multidisciplinary approach, aims to uncover specific chemical spectral patterns in the plasma of peripheral blood and bone marrow of MM patients which, together with their genetic, clinical and histopathological profile, will be used to create a predictive tool based on advanced mathematics and chemometrics including machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. The aim of this project is to significantly improve the prediction of disease progression and to contribute to the identification of novel molecular structures as targets for specific personalized therapies for MM.

Cerium oxide nanoparticles are referred to as a free radical scavenging superantioxidant. The incorporation of CeO2 into the ferritin cage will provide the necessary biocompatibility and allow modifications for targeted delivery into cardiac cells. Several peptides capable of specifically targeting cardiomyocytes have been described, which we will use to modify ferritin bearing CeO2 particles. We will analyse the specific introduction of nanocages into cells and organs together with the protective effect against cytotoxicity induced by the molecules used. Changes in cell viability, intracellular free radical levels and nanoparticle localization will be analyzed by biochemical, microscopic and electrophysiological methods.

Genetic based cardiomyopathies are windows in to the process of calcium pathophysiology, while drugs can induce severe heart failure, an undesired and relatively frequent complication of chemotherapy in cancer treatment (e.g. anthracycline). A common link is in the ryanodine receptor. Dynamic comparison of two pathways resulting in the same phenotype of cardiomyocyte will give insight in to the pathophysiology of the organ disease. The same time treatment options may be combined, as well as preventive measures. Analyses of phenotypic changes of excitation and contraction in microelectrode arrays and atomic force microscopy will allow close comparison with metabolism and gene expression in drug affected healthy and disease harboring stem cell derived cardiomyocytes.

Ph.D.;100474;Partner;LF;Ústav histologie a embryologie;Although the modern techniques provide timely diagnosis and effective treatment, both morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure remain high in Western countries. One of the most common factors that lead to HF is heterogeneous structural changes in heart tissue caused by myocardial ischemia or other cardiac disease, which result in so called dyssynchrony between right and left ventriclesor between particular parts of left ventricle. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is a powerful tool for improving the symptoms and reducing mortality in patients with HF. Depending on the character and severity of heart electromechanical abnormality, different treatment techniques can be applied, one of them is electrical stimulation. However, some limitations of electrical pacing cannot be removed because of principle of the approach itself. Alternative stimulation techniques based on UV or visible light illumination in combination with genetic modification of the tissue (so called optogenetics), high-intensity ultrasound pulses, and infra-red laser illumination have been examined under experimental conditions and most recently in human in case of ultrasound-based CRT. In contrast to the electrical pacing, the optical approaches would provide some important benefits such as: high precision of stimuli localization and, hence, more physiological pacing and reduction of the affecting the nearby tissue, absence of pacing artefact in ECG which is important for performing of analysis of QRS complexes or ST segments and, finally, possible recording of the heart electrical activity in close proximity to stimulated area which would be useful for improvement of today's and development of new diagnostic, treatment, or surgical techniques.

Nowadays, H2S is determined to be the third gasotransmitter that modulates number of metabolic and physiological processes. In mammalian cells, H2S is produced also endogenously. Recent studies revealed increased expression of various H2S producing enzymes in various cancer cell types, which points to a new role of H2S in the pathophysiology of cancer. However, exogenous H2S plays important and specific roles in many physiological and pathological activities as well. Its effect is dose dependent. At low concentrations, H2S shows cytoprotective effects while at high concentrations H2S has cytotoxic effects, such as stimulating apoptosis and cell death. Slow sulfide donor GYY4137 significantly induced death in some cancer cells by decreasing glycolysis and lactate overproduction. Thus, GYY4137 administration can be considered a novel and selective anti-cancer strategy. Although hypoxia is an important negative factor in tumor´s prognosis, effect of H2S signaling in hypoxia is not fully elucidated yet.

Its targeted therapy is directed mostly at the MAPK signaling pathway, driving cell proliferation and activated in most melanomas by mutated oncogenes BRAF or NRAS. Small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed that can delay the progression of the disease but usually cannot cure it. Recent findings show the important role of the activated MAPK pathway in the reprogramming of energy metabolism of cancer cells, suggesting new therapeutic targets.

The proposed project is aimed at confirming the preliminary results, identifying of the molecular mechanisms linking inhibition of cellular energy metabolism to the MAPK pathway in melanoma cells, and establishing the effect of this new feedback pathway on the action of BRAF inhibitors.

A number of these substances are known to exert certain cardiovascular side effects. However, detailed explanation how these adverse effects are mediated is often missing. Numerous antipsychotics used routinely in clinical practice are characterized by multiple-receptor binding. However, despite the enormous effort is given to develop innovative treatment strategies for psychoses such as schizophrenia, the currently used antipsychotics still exert their effect mainly via dopaminergic activity and both ""classical"" as well as atypical antipsychotics block D2 receptors. Therefore a deep understanding of D2 receptor family crosstalk with other receptor systems might help to preventing the adverse effects of currently used antipsychotic treatment. Results of this proposal might enlighten the role of D2 receptors in the heart physiology, where much less information about their role(s) is available at present.

The project builds on previous results which showed that some dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans, depending on their structure, are able to overcome the resistance of cancer cells to the cytostatic doxorubicin. The effect of lignans will be studied in resistant cancer cell lines with increased expression of ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein. Experiments will focus on fractionation of lignan-containing extracts from the Schisandra chinensis plant according to their ability to enhance the accumulation of the cytostatic doxorubicin in resistant tumor cells. For efficient analysis of structurally very close lignans, methods based on 1D and 2D capillary HPLC will be developed. Isolation of lignans from plant material based on their ability to inhibit P-glycoprotein and semi-synthetic modification of lignans will allow for more active derivatives and the identification of key structural requirements necessary for effective P-glycoprotein inhibition.

RNDr. Ph.D., MBA;106107;Partner;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;Our recently published mathematical models have shown that during cellular activity, membrane ion transport causes significant changes in ion concentrations in cardiac t-tubules and interstitial clefts. Under physiological conditions, these changes reduce Ca2+ loading in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the cellular inotropic state. In contrast, the consequences and extent of ion-concentration changes in extracellular spaces involving t-tubules during pathological conditions affecting the function of the membrane transport system remain unresolved. We hypothesize that during metabolic inhibition, ion-concentration changes in extracellular compartments may affect cellular activity to a much greater extent than under physiological conditions, primarily due to activation of the ATP-sensitive K+ current IK,ATP and subsequent extracellular K+ accumulation. The aim of this project is to investigate the effects of ion-concentration changes in extracellular compartments on cellular electrical activity and transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ ions during metabolic inhibition by means of cellular mathematical models supplemented with new experimental data.

Imatinib, a selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, represents the first-line treatment for most patients. The second-line drugs are the much more effective higher-generation TKi (dasatinib and nilotinib, or ponatinib). Especially nilotinib but also ponatinib show cardio- and vasculotoxic effects. CML is mainly diagnosed in elderly patients. In this age group there is a higher incidence of hypertension, therefore the coincidence of hypertension and cardio-/vasculotoxicity induced by TKi is more likely. The aim of this project is to investigate a number of factors associated with cardio- and vasculotoxicity in in vitro experiments in order to determine the role of ER stress and autophagy/apoptosis, using a comprehensive approach. Determination of these mechanisms is essential for designing a feasible prevention strategy, but also for early diagnosis and further therapy strategy.

CSc.;104691;Příjemce;LF;Biologický ústav;One of the biggest obstacles to the production of pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for regenerative medicine is cell adaptation, accompanied by genome destabilization. To protect the genome, hPSCs have increased base excision DNA repair (BER) and homologous recombination (HR) activity, while the activity of non-homologous DNA end joining and microhomology-based alternative splicing (MMEJ) remains constant. Our hypothesis proposes that clusters of oxidative damage to DNA bases are converted via BER into double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are further repaired error-free by rapid MMEJ, while pluripotency-controlling proteins cooperate to protect DNA ends from HR and NHEJ. Adapted hPSCs, also use this combination of pathways to repair DSBs induced by increased replicative stress. The result is misrepair and increased mutation frequency of hPSCs. The aim of this project is to test this hypothesis and to show that chemical redirection of double-strand break repair from MMEJ to HR in adapted hPSCs can reduce the mutation frequency, allowing longer and more efficient cultivation of pluripotent stem cells.

How is the sequential process of formation of these diverse cell types regulated in the human brain? What are the molecular mechanisms that govern cell fate decisions in our brains? These questions remain to be clarified. Our unpublished data indicate that the RHO/ROCK signaling pathway plays a key role in driving regulatory pathways that control cell specification during brain development. This proposed project aims to investigate how RHO/ROCK signaling controls the sequential production of neural stem cells, and to further elucidate the role of the RHO-ROCK-AKTIN regulatory axis in neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons) during brain development.

MUDr. Ph.D.;142058;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Klinika radiační onkologie;In humans, there are 54 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that respond to extracellular signals mediated by more than 100 ligands. Because each cell responds to many different stimuli simultaneously, there must be specific intracellular mechanisms of RTK signaling that allow cells to respond precisely to their environment. Detailed characterization of these mechanisms is one of the major challenges of modern biology. Recent findings demonstrate that unrelated RTKs can interact and activate (transactivate) each other. Although these unusual RTK interactions play an important role in the mechanisms of RTK function in the organism, they remain the least understood area of RTK signaling to date. The aim of the proposed project is to identify most of the existing transactivations between human RTKs. We will then define the molecular mechanisms of RTK transactivations and determine the functional consequences of transactivations for RTK signaling in cells. Characterization of RTK transactivations will deepen the fundamental understanding of RTK function and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of tumors caused by pathological RTK signaling.

It is often very difficult to identify the causative organisms of these infections without amplification or culture within hours to ensure optimal antimicrobial therapy. The proposed project envisages a novel method of preconcentration, pre-separation of selected microorganisms including viruses from real clinical samples using newly developed phenotypic electrofocusing techniques and their subsequent analysis using electrophoretic techniques. The obtained information on the characteristic surface properties of whole cells together with subsequent on-/off-line analysis by MALDI-TOF MS will be used in the identification of pathogens under simultaneous control by PCR. The results will be compared before and after their cultivation together with a comparison of the properties of cultured microorganisms and those collected from clinical samples. The end result will be to propose a new methodology for rapid identification of pathogens of serious infections.

PhDr. Ph.D.;98239;Partner;LF;Ústav zdravotnických věd;Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) represent one of the main tools of intercellular communication. Pathological activation of FGFR leads to more than 20 diseases such as growth disorders, metabolic syndromes and tumors. Sustained activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway is known to be a major mediator of FGFR function in the cell, although the mechanism of this phenomenon is still unclear. Our preliminary experiments point to complex protein regulatory networks that function at multiple levels and enable sustained activation of the ERK pathway by FGFR. These include mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, FGFR interaction with members of their signaling complexes, mechanisms regulating FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in FGFR inhibition. The goal of this project is to describe the mechanisms enabling sustained activation of the ERK pathway in the major FGFR-regulated processes in the organism. Elucidating the mechanisms regulating FGFR-ERK signalling is key to understanding the underlying processes of FGFR function and will help identify new therapeutic approaches to treat diseases caused by FGFR deregulation.

The endoplasmic reticulum, responds to various stress stimuli by a molecular mechanism that determines cellular and tissue responses. The ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) is a surface structure of the mammalian ovary that allows detailed study of the mechanisms of tissue regeneration or senescence. While the events associated with the UPR have been studied in detail by us in ovarian malignancies, their role in the regeneration and senescence of the normal OSE has not been satisfactorily described. In this project, we will 1) monitor UPR activity in normal OSE in a temporospatial and histopathological context, 2) study the interactions between UPR, senescence, and OSE tissue plasticity, and 3) use a model of OSE as a variable, non-malignant epithelium to study the role of novel ER regulators in epithelial plasticity. Thus, this project will contribute to the understanding of the clinically relevant role of ER stress in human ovarian epithelium and, as a result, to future personalized therapies for ovarian malignancies.

Whilst it was originally described as vestigial organelle and hence largely neglected, recent years have indisputably proven its status as a seminal structure for sensing various extracellular stimuli. In vertebrates, primary cilium governs many important aspects of embryonic development as well as tissue homeostasis in adulthood. Given that, it is not surprising that a numerous human diseases, known as ciliopathies, have been directly related to defects in assembly of primary cilia. Thus, full understanding of the biology of primary cilia is of interest for basic as well as more clinically oriented research.

MVDr. CSc.;105600;Příjemce;LF;Ústav histologie a embryologie;Most vertebrate cells have a highly specialized organelle on their surface, the primary cilium, which concentrates a number of signaling pathways and mediates intercellular communication. A properly functioning cilia is an essential component of healthy development and aging in all ciliated organisms, including humans. In our recently published work, we found that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is a widespread mode of regulating cilia length and function, and that diseases associated with aberrant FGF signaling such as achondroplasia are ciliaopathies. In the present work, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of FGF interaction with cilia, which is the interaction of FGF receptors with intestinal cell kinase (ICK). ICK is a known and evolutionarily conserved regulator of primary target length and function. Deletion of ICK leads to deregulation of cilia length, and loss of kinase activity in humans leads to lethal skeletal cilia and is associated with tumors. In this work, we found that the FGF receptor interacts with ICK, phosphorylates ICK on several tyrosines, thereby partially reducing its kinase activity and altering cilia length and activity. These results deepen our understanding of the physiological function of the cilia, as well as the principles underlying the origin and development of pathologies such as skeletal ciliaopathies and tumors.

TPA cannot be studied using traditional microbiological approaches since this bacterium cannot be cultured under in vitro conditions. Clinical samples isolated directly from patients contain massive amount of contaminant human DNA. This fact prevents straightforward TPA sequence analyses. This grant application serves to provide funds needed to finish final experiments for project planning to introduce a new culture-independent enrichment method using methyl-directed restriction endonuclease, which selectively binds bacterial DNA in heterogeneous samples. Subsequently, next generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing of paralogous and repetitive regions was shown to be able to reconstruct the complete genome sequences of TPA isolated directly from patients without any biases. Moreover, we applied this new technique to the 26 clinical samples and described different genetics of two distinct subgroups of strains causing modern syphilis.  Accumulation of TPA genetic data will help to select candidate loci for development of vaccine against syphilis. To our knowledge, there is no such approach described until now and we believe this methodology will be adopted by other researchers.

The mentioned best practices include case-based learning (CBL) in medicine, dentistry and pharmacology with the use of ICT platforms. The project duration is 36 months. The target groups are: (i) Students in all three countries (1st level: UMF, 2nd level: MU and UPJS, 3rd level: MEFANET and other associated networks), (ii) Teachers from UMF Iasi (42). Two skillsets will be delivered by lecturers from MU and UPJS to 42 teachers in UMF (faculty of medicine, fa. of pharmacy, fa. of dentistry). The first skillset is connected to pedagogy methods coming from scenario-based learning field (case-based learning, problem-based learning, team-based learning, hackathons, flipped classrooms, etc.). The second skillset is connected to various ICT platforms usable to support scenario-based learning didactic approaches - in medicine, of course connected to virtual patients (virtual cases). After analysis of needs performed in the field of (i) pedagogy and (ii) medical informatics, we will train the teachers and use them as authoring force supported by PhD students, in order to create 28 interactive virtual cases. The cases will be authored in Romanian language and later translated into English and French to be used also by international students in UMF, MU and UPJS.

MUDr. Ph.D.;60276;Příjemce;LF;Klinika nemocí plicních a tuberkul.;P53 is a protein and transcription factor involved in a myriad of physiological events. Its role as a crucial tumor suppressor has been well-established, however its contribution to other processes such as embryonic development has only recently been revealed. Interestingly, p53 has been shown to regulate mesoendodermal differentiation via direct activation of the Wnt pathway and indirect influence of Smad signaling molecules. Such unexpected discoveries suggest that p53 might have other important regulatory roles during human embryonic development. This prompted us to utilize the expertise in our laboratory to explore the protein's behavior during neuroectodermal differentiation in vitro, using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cerebral organoids. Organoids represent a 3D in vitro model which produces structures reminiscent of the human brain, and it has recently been implemented in our laboratory. To study the role of p53, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete p53 from hESCs and induced the cells to form cerebral organoids. Our preliminary finding showed that the absence of p53 strongly enhances the neural development in vitro and generates cerebral organoids with better neuronal morphology and higher expression of neuronal markers. We therefore aim to explore this phenomenon further. Firstly, using molecular techniques such as qPCR, we will quantify the expression of various neural markers, such as Sox2, β-3-tubulin, Doublecortin and others. In parallel, we will describe possible differences between the growth rate and cell cycle mechanics of wild-type and p53KO (knockout) cells. Secondly, we will functionally visualize the electric potential of the neurons within the cerebral organoids. And lastly, we will initiate experiments to identify molecular pathways responsible for the different p53KO phenotype. Collectively, our findings will aid in completing the repertoire of the enigmatic protein's actions, as well as potentially unveil completely new pathways taking place during human neural development.

Strategies based on human pluripotent stem cells seem to enable the generation of cells and tissues for use in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Recent findings provide a basis for further investigation and, in particular, clinical application of human pluripotent stem cell technology. Nevertheless, there are a number of obstacles that limit and delay the wider use of stem cells in clinical practice. One such limitation is the risk of genetic alterations in in vitro propagated stem cells. We have previously shown that centrosomal amplifications (excess centrosomes) occur in human pluripotent stem cells, a phenomenon generally associated with genetic instability. In this project we will focus on:

72521;1490/2018;Modernization of teaching of cardiac cellular electrophysiology;Macháček Martin, MUDr.;446336;Příjemce;LF;Fyziologický ústav;In patients with mesotemporal epilepsy, we often find the occurrence of febrile convulsions in the history. This correlation is described in 30-40% of epileptics. The symptoms include not only frequent epileptic seizures, but also memory problems, depression and personality changes (Brázdil et al, 2004). The mechanism of hippocampal sclerosis preceded by febrile convulsions has not been clarified yet. There are studies in the international literature supporting a direct correlation between febrile convulsions and the subsequent development of hippocampal sclerosis (Kuks et al, 1993), as well as evidence of hippocampal atrophy following febrile convulsions (Darrell et al, 2014). On the other hand, there are also published studies that do not support this theory and lean towards the idea that the brain is already primarily damaged, subsequently febrile convulsions develop and this causes damage to the already altered hippocampus, its edema and atrophy (Keith et al, 1996, Simon et al, 2000). So far, there is no study dealing with this issue in the Czech Republic. Our aim is therefore to perform a retrospective study and to confirm or refute the correlation between the occurrence of febrile convulsions and the development of hippocampal sclerosis.

MUDr. Ph.D.;1998;Příjemce;LF;Stomatologická klinika;Fusion reserves provide us with significant insights into the client's belief system. By measuring them, we can detect, for example, an insufficiency or, conversely, an excess of some component in the vergence-accommodation system. In practice, we encounter a number of techniques by which we can obtain this data. Fusion reserves are measured both remotely and proximally in both real and instrumented space. The different techniques differ in the degree of dissociation of the images of the right and left eye. Therefore, in the practical part of this work we will address the question of whether the degree of dissociation has an effect on the magnitude of the measured fusion reserves. We will measure positive fusion reserves at a distance using a phoropter, an LCD optotype and a synoptophore. We will use prisms, anaglyph filters, polarizing filters, and a synoptophor as dissociation factors.

CSc.;104691;Příjemce;LF;Biologický ústav;Wearable electronics, or 'wereables' in English, is an extremely important area of future technological development. Wereables are not just smart watches, for example, but in particular a range of wearable devices that include biosensors, implants, biomedical devices, electrochemical cells that use body fluids to generate electricity and supercapacitors. These devices represent a huge potential in improving quality of life and safety. For example, in the biomedical field in individual point-of-care treatment, where, for example, disease is detected and constantly monitored directly by a wearable device on the patient, and where the wearable device can also inject the appropriate volume of drug into the body. In the case of security forces, the sensor enables constant monitoring and early warning in the presence of dangerous substances, such as explosives and nerve agents or improvised variants thereof. This project will focus on the research and development of wearable sensors, biosensors and biofuel cells in the form of electrochemical patches, electrochemical tattoos and wearable smart clothing with embedded polyfunctional polymer biocomponents to efficiently transform biomolecules into electrochemical signals and electrical energy. This project will focus on the fundamental research of these wearable electrochemical devices, from electron transport and electron transfer enzyme pairing to the engineering part of the design and proof-of-concept demonstration of these devices.

However, the safe and effective use of any stem cell type is completely dependent on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence stem cell behavior, our ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into functional somatic cell types, or our ability to generate and influence the three-dimensional arrangement of stem and progenitor cells. The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, (i) the molecular mechanisms responsible for the genetic instability of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, (ii) methods for isolation and characterization of the extracellular matrix and their impact on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, and (iii) microfluidic systems will be developed to coculture multiple types of stem and progenitor cells, (iv) the involvement of miRNA molecules in controlling differentiation and establishing stem cell plasticity will be investigated, (v) methods for forming 3D cell aggregates and differentiating them into specific tissue types will be developed, and (vi) protocols for differentiating hES cells into relevant cell types, particularly lung epithelial and neural lineages, will be further developed. The main experimental approaches will be in vitro manipulation of cells, imaging of live and fixed cells with advanced microscopy techniques, and quantification of relevant mRNAs and proteins for molecular phenotyping of cell populations.

Ph.D.;14045;Příjemce;PřF;Ústav biochemie;Resectional epilepsy surgery is currently the only potentially curative treatment method in epileptology. However, the selection of suitable candidates for surgery is not easy and cannot be done without ancillary paraclinical examinations that help to define the epileptogenic zone (the area of the brain whose surgical removal will lead to seizure-free survival). A standard part of this pre-surgical preparation is, among other things, visual analysis of interictal brain PET, which is, however, largely subjective. The objective output of this examination is offered only by its advanced processing based on the principle of statistical parametric mapping (SPM), which can be performed by two methods - global normalization (GN) and asymmetry index (AI). Since cortical functional activity, which can be defined on the basis of local metabolic changes using PET, is subject to maturation and different parts of the cortex are more active than others at different ages, it is difficult to establish a universal childhood norm. The aim of this project is therefore to compare the two SPM methodologies in paediatric patients and to evaluate whether a control group of adult patients can be used for the paediatric population.
72484;1463/2018;Factors determining the development and healing of wounds in intensive care - risk factors corresponding to differential diagnosis (acronym RIFADIAG);Saibertová Simona, PhDr. Ph.D.;156459;Příjemce;LF;Ústav zdravotnických věd;In recent decades, modern diagnostic procedures and imaging-guided interventions have made major advances in the treatment of cancer patients. Not only diagnostic imaging methods have undergone improvements, but also invasive endovascular or intratumoral treatment techniques. Advances in diagnostics allow searching for malignant disease in its early stages, allow more detailed characterization of the patient's diseased tissue, and provide information about the individual characteristics of a particular lesion. The integration of the findings of these new diagnostic methods into the patient's therapeutic plan enables the individualization of procedures in modern oncological treatment. Minimally invasive radiological-oncological interventions not only use imaging methods during surgery, but as the first of the therapeutic methods, they can use a spectrum of advanced imaging methods to monitor treatment response. The aim of the project is to analyse the benefit of specific diagnostic and therapeutic procedures used at the Comprehensive Cancer Centre of the Masaryk Cancer Institute in Brno in collaboration with the University Hospital Brno and the University Hospital U St. Anne in comparison with national data. The research will focus on PET/MR modality, advanced volumetric analysis, correlation of radiological and molecular markers (miRNA). Treatment outcomes for selected diagnoses of primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma) and secondary liver cancer (especially metastases from colorectal cancer) where radiological interventional approaches have been used will be critically evaluated in comparison to data from other comprehensive cancer centers where advanced methods were not available. The project is a continuation of a specific research project carried out in 2015 at our clinic within the framework of the Masaryk University Faculty of Medicine projects.
72500;1461/2018;Creation of teaching aids for Propedeutics, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine - 3D scanning and printing;Dadák Lukáš, MUDr. Ph.D.;15740;Příjemce;LF;Anesteziolog.-resuscitační klinika;Glioblastoma is the most aggressive glial tumour with a progressive behaviour and a very unfavourable prognosis. The main obstacle in the effective treatment of glioblastoma is its invasive growth into peritumoral brain tissue limiting the effect of resection and its intratumoral biological heterogeneity weakening the efficacy of cancer therapy. Residual disease in the peritumoral brain zone is treated oncologically based on tissue analysis of the tumor mass that was removed at surgery. However, given the high intratumoral heterogeneity, we cannot be certain that the characteristics of the residual disease are the same as those described in the tissue obtained by surgery. This fact may account for the failure of previous efforts at targeted biological therapy for glioblastoma. The aim of this project is to study and describe the heterogeneity of relevant histopathological biomarkers at the resection border of glioblastoma, i.e., the tumor-peritumoral boundary of the tumor infiltration area targeted by adjuvant cancer therapy. A better understanding of residual disease in the peritumoral brain zone is critical to unravel the mechanisms responsible for glioblastoma recurrence in order to optimize surgical resection and develop new therapeutic approaches.

Current recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndrome favour the use of high-sensitivity troponin (hs-Tn) for very rapid diagnosis and risk stratification. The cut-off values used to assess the dynamics for the so-called rule-out/rule-in protocols (0-1h/ 0-3h protocol) are based on the monitoring of large patient cohorts, but no prospective validation of these established procedures in real clinical practice has been performed so far. The aim of this study is to prospectively validate the newly proposed algorithms in patients with chest pain using hs-Tn ; to compare the safety and efficacy of the shortened 0-1h protocol with the recommended 0-3h protocol; to evaluate the use of hs-Tn to identify patients with myocardial infarction II.type (secondary ischaemia in patients with hypertensive crisis, tachyarrhythmias, etc.) and to determine the contribution of echocardiography in the decision-making algorithm in patients with chest pain.

Methyltransferases catalyze methylation of histones and non-histone proteins, and play crucial roles in diverse biological processes, including initiation and progression of cancer. DOT1L was found to be critical for leukemogenesis of several mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) subtypes and represents a suitable target for selective killing of leukemia cells. However, we are not aware of any reports on a role of DOT1L in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, DOT1L is expressed in CLL cells (in-house data from expression microarray) which we very recently found to be considerably sensitive to our proprietary C-nucleoside inhibitors.

It follows the project MUNI/A/1332/2016. The aim is to further develop the achieved original results in personalized treatment approach in children with refractory and relapsed solid tumors and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Our analyses of tumor tissue include transcriptional profiling, next-generation sequencing (NGS) - TruSight Tumor panel and NGS Agilent (whole exome/genome sequencing); and detection of phosphorylation of receptor kinases and MAP kinases by proteomic methods. Since 2017, we have also introduced the detection of specific translocations/gene fusions (RNAseq) to our comprehensive testing panel. Our proposed comprehensive development of tumor tissue investigation (histopathology, genomic, transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic testing) together with bioinformatics support, lead to a deepening of our knowledge of the molecular profile of the tumor and the genetic background of the host. Based on previous analyses, personalized treatment could be applied, based on the recommendations of an expert panel (molecular tumor board), in approximately 60% of cases. We expect that by further deepening this innovative approach and applying it in clinical practice, we will further improve treatment responses in a significant percentage of children with refractory malignancies. The emphasis on repeated examinations of the tumor tissue of the same patient (repeated biopsies for recurrent/progressive disease, clonal evolution) follows the latest trends in oncology and is moving towards ""liquid dynamic medicine"" and ""N-of-1 clinical trials""."

The current body of research supports the concept that protein aggregation initiates the onset of Alzheimer's disease. However, in spite of the large number of available literature and studies, a mechanism of pathogenesis and potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease remains elusive. Here we apply modern and highly specific analytical techniques to relevant in vitro models able to comprehensively capture all important aspects of the human neuropathology. Implementation of such models to study Alzheimer's disease will allow for proper hypothesis testing and will drive important findings. For that reason, general objective of proposed interdisciplinary and interfaculty project is to develop and apply state-of-the-art analytical methodology to a newly introduced cell biology model to study and potentially elucidate hypothetical mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Specifically, we aim to develop modern analytical tools suitable to determine levels of gangliosides and proteins primarily involved in aggregation. Simultaneously, we will establish an adequate in vitro model based on cerebral organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells, suitable to test hypothetical mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Subsequently, we will apply analytical methodology to the conceptual model exploring the influence of gangliosides on the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Finally, we also aim to challenge the in vitro cellular model with an environmental perturbation (e.g. microorganisms) and capture the resulting pathological impacts in relation to Alzheimer's disease. We believe that proposed combination of analytical technology with disease modeling using stem cells provides a unique opportunity to bring an urgently needed new perspective to the field of Alzheimer's disease research.

Hearing defects affect 1:1000 physiological newborns and 20-40:1000 pathological newborns. Compared to other childhood diseases that are picked up by full-body screening, such as phenylketonuria (1:4500 newborns) or hypothyroidism (1:4000 newborns), this is a very common disability with far-reaching consequences. Up to 60% of hearing defects are congenital, occurring during the first trimester of pregnancy, and 40% are acquired. A child with a hearing loss is at risk of delayed psychomotor development, limited learning ability, difficulties in integrating into society, and problems in entering the labour market later in life. Modern medicine is constantly looking for ways to adequately rehabilitate hearing. The aim of the project is to monitor the effectiveness and compare different options of hearing rehabilitation (cochlear implants, hearing aids, BAHA, middle ear implants) in children of different ages and with different types of hearing loss. The project builds on the results of the 2018 research.

Important professions are the so-called helping professions, which aim to support the development of a person's personality (their education, health, mental and physical fitness). A high level of professional performance is ensured, among other things, by the interconnection of the professions with the disciplines cultivated at universities - the link being the preparatory (undergraduate) and continuing (lifelong) education of professionals. In the dynamics of changing conditions for the professions, their (self-)perception, scope, content and structure of activities are also changing. The professions are in transition - undergoing changes caused by global trends, departmental policies and other external and internal influences. The aim of the project is to find out what transitions the helping professions are currently undergoing in the Czech Republic and to evaluate the possible consequences for related fields of study and academic disciplines at Masaryk University, or at universities in general (or in terms of departmental policies applied to the professions). The research is intended to capture what is currently changing in the conception, scope, content and performance of the professions under study during transitions. In the first phase (2019), an expert survey based on in-depth interviews with representatives of the professions (practicing professionals, representatives of professional communities and educators of professionals) will be conducted. Subsequently (2020), a broad-based questionnaire survey among professionals and their educators will be carried out to observe transitions and issues specific to each profession and the implications of transitions for the education of professionals. In the third phase (2021), the issue of interprofessionalism and interdisciplinarity will be addressed - through case studies, professions operating at the boundaries of disciplines and professional fields will be explored (it is envisaged that some emerging interprofessions will be documented). In extension of the cognitive goal of the research, the researchers' ambition is to draw from the findings suggestions for conceptual, content, methodological, or other adjustments to the preparatory and continuing education of professionals at universities. The project will enable MU to establish a professional platform on which it will be possible to confront current problems (academic failure, turnover and drop-out, weakening interest in further education, etc.) with the support of research data.

Ph.D.;67594;Partner;LF;Ústav histologie a embryologie;Oocyte cytoplasmic polarity and embryonic pre-patterning are well documented features of development in sub-mammalian species. Whether the same spatially controlled development occurs in mammals remains under debate. Several studies challenge the traditional view of the mammalian oocyte possessing spherical symmetry suggesting pre-determination based on asymmetrical distribution of maternal factors. Here, we propose to address this long-lasting controversy of mammalian oocyte polarity by leveraging the power of the new cutting-edge techniques cryo-qPCR-tomography and Tomo-RNA-Seq, that we have developed to study the intracellular localization of biological molecules in human eggs. The two techniques have proven exceedingly powerful to elucidate global RNA localization gradients in amphibian and fish oocytes. Based on experience with animal models we apply these tools to analyze human eggs using the position of polar bodies as a determinant of the first developmental axis. This topological expression analysis will determine localization profiles of maternal transcripts related to pluripotency and lineage commitment, and also identify new asymmetrically localized maternal factors. Our study will reveal pivotal aspect of human oocyte development and may, in addition to increasing our knowledge about early human development, have profound impact on a variety of micromanipulation procedures used in human embryology and IVF.

RNDr. Ph.D.;10009;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Klinika dětské onkologie;Paediatric oncology has achieved dramatic results over the last thirty years, with mortality rates for children with cancer falling by more than 50%. However, there are still 15-20% of children whose adverse course of their disease cannot be reversed. For these patients, new, individualized treatment strategies must be sought. Detailed molecular biological characterization of the tumor is a prerequisite for this concept of so-called precision medicine. In addition to changes in the coding regions of the DNA (tumor exome), there are other molecular changes that contribute to the development of cancer. These include epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, or gene structural rearrangements that lead to fusion genes. Many of these methylation changes and fusion genes strongly influence tumour behaviour and can be targeted by available drugs or are important prognostic factors. The overall aim of the project is to test whether the analysis of global methylation profiles and fusion genes provides a benefit for therapeutic planning in paediatric patients with high-risk solid tumours where the tumour exome sequence is known.

Compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA), it does not cause thermal necrosis and leads to targeted and specific triggering of apoptosis and changes in tissue conductance. IRE, so far used only in oncology, is a new option to address arrhythmias, potentially reducing their recurrence and RFA-related complications. However, the method needs to be optimized for use in the atria and ventricles. Cardiomyocytes prepared from human pluripotent cells allow in-vitro monitoring of the effect and extent of selective cell death. New ablation balloons, catheters and ECG synchronization are the basis for the use of IRE in.vivo. Pulmonary vein orifices, the ventricular wall and the AV node will be selectively ablated in a chronic experiment. The efficacy and safety of the procedure will be evaluated using surface ECG, invasive electrophysiology, magnetic resonance imaging and then histology.

We propose to show a functional relationship between the genomic instability of DMD/BMD human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) caused by reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) produced by NO synthase (NOS) and cardiac progenitor (CP) depletion in mdx mice lacking dystrophin. The proposed study, using NOS/ROS inhibitors on DMD/BMD hPSCs and on mdx mice, will provide a molecular target for potential pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, based on the data obtained on the involvement of CP in LV pathology in MDX animals, we propose to compare CP involvement in mdx mice with LV morphological parameters from standard echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging of DMD/BMD patients and with their MRC scale scores to obtain an estimate of the onset of CP depletion in DMD/BMD patients.

RNDr. Ph.D., MBA;106107;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder resulting from a chromosomal translocation, the product of which is a chimeric BCR-ABL protein with unregulated kinase activity. Inhibition of BCR-ABL with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is the standard treatment for CML and most patients respond positively to TKI administration. However, TKIs often do not lead to eradication of the disease due to newly acquired BCR-ABL mutations causing resistance to TKIs. The new allosteric inhibitor ABL001 allows dual inhibition of BCR-ABL and thus overcoming TKI resistance. Early clinical trial results show a strong and durable response in patients with TKI-resistant CML to ABL001, but also its toxicity, which may be a barrier to future therapies. The molecular mechanisms of these side effects are unknown and are the subject of this proposal. The main goal of the project is to characterize the activity of ABL001 against all known human tyrosine kinases in vitro and in vivo to identify its other targets. Understanding and capturing these side effects may subsequently lead to safer therapies for CML.

It involves the transfer of fat tissue in an injectable form. The advantages of fat grafting are low invasiveness, low number of surgical complications, short hospitalization and fast recovery after surgery. The method can also be used in cancer patients, where immediately after mastectomy (within one operation) part of the volume can be replaced by fat transfer in injection form into the m. pectoralis. Partial breast reconstruction performed at the same time as mastectomy creates an initial volume for the reconstructed breast, which is essential for planning subsequent reconstruction. However, the details of the effect of radiotherapy on the fat graft in terms of the rate of absorption of the transferred volume are unknown.

Muscular imbalances and developmental defects of the musculoskeletal system due to asymmetric loading are considered the primary cause. Significant changes in the overall stability of standing and walking are observed in children undergoing surgical correction and stabilization of the affected spinal segments. The average increase in patient height after surgery ranges from 4-10 cm. This factor is negatively reflected in difficulties after surgery in terms of unstable gait, bumping into surrounding objects while walking and increased risk of falls. In addition to data from standard clinical and kinesiological examinations, sophisticated 3D gait analysis and computer modelling methods will be used in the proposed project. The aim of the project is to propose a standard examination methodology based on targeted analysis of movement patterns preoperatively, 4 months and 1 year postoperatively and their change over time, and to demonstrate in a prospective study of a sample of 100 patients that identification of pathological movement patterns can be a differentiating factor for improving preoperative planning, accelerating postoperative correction of muscle imbalances and for long-term maintenance of deformity correction.

The increased risk of CVD may also be due to a different body composition with a higher proportion of body fat in psoriasis patients compared to the healthy population. White adipose tissue produces a number of agents, detectable even in the periphery, which may also be involved in autoimmune inflammation in psoriasis and may increase the risk of associated diseases. Using comparative untargeted proteomics methods, we will identify circulating adipose tissue-associated molecules that allow assessment of psoriatic inflammation and estimation of risk of associated diseases. Selection of appropriate adipose tissue-derived biomarkers will allow early assessment of CVD risk and may also contribute to an individualized treatment approach and reduce the risk associated with inappropriate treatment strategies. This approach is not currently available in dermatology, and the eventual development of a diagnostic kit for early detection of cardiovascular risk will benefit patients.

After retrograde menstruation, living endometrial tissue cells escape apoptosis and immune surveillance, leading to acute inflammation in the peritoneal microenvironment. It is imperative to better understand the origin of the immunopathophysiology of endometriosis, which affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. We aim to analyze resident and recruited immune cells including gamma-delta (gd) T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, immunosuppressive MDSC populations, and regulatory T cells in patients with endometriosis. This study also focuses on detailed investigation of gd T cell interactions in endometrial tissue, analysis of secreted cytokines promoting severe chronic inflammation, hormonal dysregulation of progesterone, and identification of key genes that may be part of future immunotherapy for endometriosis.

Therapeutic approaches to immunotherapy of GBM have limited success, mainly due to the protected brain barrier and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. New research suggests the possibility of using immune effector cells to effectively destroy malignant GBM cells. Our previous study showed that innate gamma-delta (gd) T cells were highly reactive to GBM tumor. The goal of the proposed project is cellular and molecular analysis of gd T cells in patients before and during treatment, including detailed characterization of their interactions with GBM cells and identification of important markers in the tumor microenvironment that are responsible for resistance to therapy and disease relapse. Current research plans to eliminate residual tumor cells using gd T cells provide a platform for GBM immunotherapy.

MUDr. Ph.D.;54879;Příjemce;LF;Psychiatrická klinika;Refinement of differential diagnosis and identification of predictors of improved left ventricular function and prognosis in patients with newly developed dilated cardiomyopathy (RODCM) is of great clinical importance. Although bio-optical diagnosis identifies a group with greater potential for improvement in left ventricular function, it often fails in individual cases. Therefore, the addition of non-invasive investigative methods to improve diagnosis, estimation of future left ventricular function and prognostic stratification would be of great value. This study is based on the evaluation of the expression of a number of proteins that may be involved in the pathogenesis of RODCM, in addition to clinically commonly used methods such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging. The main objective of the project will be to identify early changes in molecular, pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic parameters, as well as to assess changes in perfusion, cellular integrity and immunological effects. To achieve this goal, in vivo and ex vivo as well as in vitro studies will be performed. A central component of the project will be the identification of novel proteins involved in the above processes related to the pathogenesis of non-ischemic heart failure, particularly those of inflammatory aetiology.

The presumed pathological mechanism of AEA is Th2 lymphocyte-mediated inflammation and, among others, reduced function of IL-10-producing induced T regulatory cells (iTreg) and increased serum gelatinase B (MMP9) levels. The iTregs are generated during CD4+ T cell activation, which is also influenced by intracellular complement. Pharmacologically, vitamin D may further influence this activation. The project is focused on monitoring CD46, C3aR, C5aR receptors in iTreg, their influence by vitamin D in vitro in patients with AEA. IL-10 production of iTreg obtained by anti-CD3 + anti-CD46 stimulation will also be monitored using culture experiments, as well as MMP9 production in supernatants of stimulated cells. Increased MMP9 concentration decreases CD46 expression and thus iTreg activity along with IL-10 production. Vitamin D, on the other hand, increases IL-10 production and restores iTreg function, which could lead to amelioration of immune system reactivity in AEA patients.

The increased susceptibility to atrial and ventricular fibrillation is probably due to the acute effect of these drugs on the electrical properties of cardiac cells. We selected potassium currents of the inward rectifier (Kir) type as candidates because they play an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrillation. In addition to the effect alone, the combined effect with normal plasma barium concentrations will be studied, both for these drugs and for other substances acting on Kir channels (e.g. ethanol, acetaldehyde, or nicotine). Experiments will be performed on isolated rat and human cardiac cells and on expressed human Kir channels. This will be followed by in vivo ECG analysis in laboratory rats and mathematical simulations in cardiac cell models to investigate the pro-arrhythmogenic properties of these compounds. By elucidating the changes in cardiac Kir currents induced by the selected drugs, this study may help prevent the occurrence of arrhythmias in patients treated with these drugs.

Detailed analysis of EGFR activity and downstream signaling pathways will be performed in three most common types of sarcomas (osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma). Samples of native or frozen tumor tissue, and cell lines derived from them, will be included in the study. The aim of the project is to characterize EGFR expression and activation, including downstream signaling pathways, and to compare differences in signaling in pediatric and adult sarcomas. In vitro experiments will focus on the effect of inhibition of EGFR and downstream signaling pathways by low molecular weight inhibitors on cell proliferation, differentiation, and induction of cell death. The antitumor effects of inhibition of these signaling pathways will be verified in vivo in a mouse model using tumorigenic sarcoma cell lines. The results may provide new insights into EGFR signaling as a suitable therapeutic target in pediatric sarcomas.

It is characterized by slow growth with the ability to metastasize, especially to the lungs. Chondrosarcomas of the axial skeleton with a high degree of malignancy have the worst prognosis. As it is a chemoresistant and radioresistant tumour, the success of treatment is determined only by the radicality of the primary surgery. The prognosis of patients with inoperable tumor is infaustive. Some types of cartilaginous tumors contain mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. These mutations may be related to the dedifferentiation of cartilaginous tumors and thus the prognosis of patients. Differentiating chondrosarcoma from the chondroblastic variant of osteosarcoma is difficult but essential for therapeutic management. A positive isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation result strongly favours the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. Targeting these metabolic pathways could be a new strategy in the treatment of inoperable or metastatic chondrosarcomas.

Borderline personality disorder appears to be a good fit for rTMS applications because one of the key neural mechanisms of the disorder is impaired connectivity between the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex, which is well reached by TMS coils. Yet, to date, there are only five studies that have investigated the use of this method in patients with borderline personality disorder. In our department, as part of a previous grant project, we initiated a pilot study of rTMS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with borderline personality disorder. Previous studies and our pilot data suggest that this is a very promising method for reducing acute difficulties in these patients.  The current study is therefore a randomized sham stimulation-controlled trial of the effects of prefrontal rTMS in patients with borderline personality disorder. Fifteen patients will be enrolled in both the active and sham arms and will undergo a three-week stimulation protocol involving 15 sessions. The effects of stimulation will be measured at the clinical and neural levels, using both MRI and EEG measurements. The immediate effect of rTMS will be monitored, as well as its sustainability at a three to six week interval.

This support system is based on an interdisciplinary team of experts who have been involved in applied ethics for a long time and have experience in assessing research projects. In addition to the ethical aspects, the support system will also include legal aspects, including data protection under the GDPR, as well as scientific integrity, as all these levels of research are interrelated and cannot be separated from each other. The outputs of the project (manuals, guidelines, handbooks, workshops) will be intended for researchers themselves, but also for the management of research organisations and members of ethics committees.
106570;0961/2020;Mitochondrial transfer and its implication in initiation and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;Raudenská Martina, Mgr. Ph.D.;42700;Příjemce;LF;Fyziologický ústav;Human inability to resist temptations and to control oneself underlies several clinical disorders including impulsive and reward-related behaviours. The main aim of the proposed project is to understand the impact of early life adversity (e.g. early life stress) on self-regulation and reward-related behaviours and to identify protective factors that might buffer the individual from developmental disruptions following early exposure to adversity. We hypothesize that (1) early life stress might modulate the development of corticostriatal and corticolimbic circuitry and increase the risk for maladaptive reward-related behavior in young adulthood, and that (2) preventive intervention focused on self-control and regulation of stress might protect high-risk adolescents (e.g. individuals born very preterm). First, we aim to complement longitudinal data from a prenatal birth cohort with a within-subject design neuroimaging data from young adulthood including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), as well as several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks characterizing one's ability of self-regulation. Subsequently, we aim to develop a preventive intervention that should improve stress regulation and decrease the prevalence of inappropriate impulse-related behaviours and addiction. Applying these interventions in the high-risk adolescents could help preserve reward-related functions in the prefrontal cortex and other reward circuitry. Effectiveness of the preventive intervention will be tested using a randomized controlled trial. This would allow us to assess the intervention-related changes in adolescents' behaviour and the underlying physiology and brain plasticity.

MUDr. Ph.D.;45693;Příjemce;LF;Ústav lékařské genetiky;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia (60-80% of cases) in the elderly population worldwide. Current research supports the idea that protein aggregation initiates the onset of AD. Despite the large body of available literature and studies, the mechanism of pathogenesis, reliable clinical markers of progression, and potential treatments for AN remain unknown. Advanced mass spectrometry techniques are opening new avenues to study biomarkers of AN. In this project, mass spectrometry will be applied to analyze a detailed characterized set of clinical samples (i.e., brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, serum) from an animal experimental model of aging as well as from participants in a longitudinal study of AN biomarkers and volunteers undergoing neurosurgery. The project is primarily concerned with the study of current hypotheses of AN due to direct or mediated immune response and inflammation, using the determination of inflammatory proteins and membrane lipids. In parallel, it envisages the establishment of a library of induced pluripotent stem cells as well as an adequate in vitro model using brain organoids cultured from human embryonic stem cells as a suitable tool for hypothesis testing. The proposed combination of biomarker studies using mass spectrometry and a cellular model to test hypotheses has the potential to transform the field of AN research.

Syphilis also poses a major threat globally with an estimated 5.6 million new cases annually and 350,000 adverse pregnancy outcomes due to mother-to-child transmission. The inability of epidemiological approaches to curtail the spread of syphilis underscores the need for a safe and effective vaccine. Our CRC proposal is based on the premise that our success identifying and topologically characterizing TPA outer membrane proteins (OMPs) translates to a roadmap for a vaccine against geographically widespread TPA strains.

Ph.D.;270498;Příjemce;LF;Biologický ústav;The project focuses on the comparison of selected methods for real-time extraction of the BOLD signal, a basic element for fMRI neurofeedback. During fMRI neurofeedback, the participant receives feedback in an MRI scan about the current level of his/her brain activity, or BOLD signal, in a predefined brain region. The current signal is provided with a minimal delay (e.g., 1 to 2 seconds). The participant's task is to try to use the feedback to influence his/her brain activity level in a certain direction (e.g., increase or decrease), and thus the participant learns to deliberately regulate his/her brain activity. fMRI neurofeedback has been successfully used in recent years to improve a number of psychiatric or neurological difficulties, such as emotion regulation, tinnitus, hallucinations, or motor and cognitive function. However, less attention has been paid to the technical parameters of fMRI neurofeedback, which play a crucial role for the accurate and successful use of this method. When extracting a real-time BOLD signal from a specific region, this signal needs to be cleaned from the global brain signal and noise. This step is crucial for the form of the signal presented as feedback to the participants and indicates how accurately this signal corresponds to the actual brain activity. We are collaborating on the project with the Central Institute for Mental Health in Mannheim, Germany, which has been involved in fMRI neurofeedback research for a long time. Three groups of healthy subjects (15 persons per group) will undergo the same task aimed at deliberately regulating amygdala activity using fMRI neurofeedback, which will be presented to each group by signal extraction using one of three selected methods. The accuracy of the extracted real-time BOLD signal and the success of amygdala regulation will be compared between the methods. Data will be collected simultaneously in the Czech Republic and Germany. The results will provide new insights into a fundamental aspect of the fMRI neurofeedback method.

The disease also involves significant disturbances in the social functioning of patients. More recently, evidence has begun to accumulate for a link between the disease and the immune system. The aim of our project is to investigate the interrelationships between the immune system, possible low-grade white matter inflammation, the state of psychopathology in patients and cognition and social cognition. For this purpose, we will recruit a total of 38 patients with schizophrenia at different stages of the disease and 38 volunteers matched for age, education and gender. For each proband, we will perform immunological sampling (18 different cytokines mapping the state of the immune system), psychological examination of cognition and social cognition, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a focus on cerebral white matter (Diffusion Tensor Imaging - DTI). The output of the project will then be to look for possible links and correlates between cytokines, neuroimaging, psychopathology, cognition and social cognition. The results will be published in impacted international journals and could serve to better understand the aetiopathogenesis of this disease and thus enable more causally focused treatments, e.g. targeting immunomodulation.

PhD.;244150;Příjemce;LF;Biologický ústav;Almost every cell in the human body has a highly specialized cell organelle, the primary cilia, on its surface. Properly functioning cilia are essential for (1) the precise formation of structures during embryonic development and (2) the homeostasis of pre-existing tissues. Deregulation of cilia function leads to the development of developmental syndromes, systemic diseases, and tumors. These diseases are collectively called ciliopathies. Cilia function is linked to many cell signaling pathways, but we understand very little about the molecular mechanisms that accompany this interaction. The aim of this study is to investigate the function of selected cellular kinases in the regulation of cilia, both during healthy development and in the development of pathology. Understanding the molecular principles of the interaction of kinases with cilia can significantly help in the treatment of ciliopathies.

The proposed project is aimed at comprehensive testing of AMPA ionotropic glutamate receptor ligands and kainate subtypes in a rat model of alcohol dependence comorbid with depression induced by an experimentally validated olfactory bulbectomy model. Experimental treatment should reduce spontaneous alcohol intake in the model, and animals with a depression-like phenotype may have different sensitivities to the substances.

Compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA), it does not cause thermal necrosis and leads to targeted and specific triggering of apoptosis and changes in tissue conductance. IRE, so far used only in oncology, is a new option to address arrhythmias, potentially reducing their recurrence and RFA-related complications. However, the method needs to be optimized for use in the atria and ventricles. Cardiomyocytes prepared from human pluripotent cells allow in-vitro monitoring of the effect and extent of selective cell death. New ablation balloons, catheters and ECG synchronization are the basis for the use of IRE in.vivo. Pulmonary vein orifices, the ventricular wall and the AV node will be selectively ablated in a chronic experiment. The efficacy and safety of the procedure will be evaluated using surface ECG, invasive electrophysiology, magnetic resonance imaging and then histology.

Ph.D.;242192;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Inst.biostatistiky a analýz;Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are essential for controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and for regulating cell metabolism and survival. The RTK family consists of many different receptors, each activated by its specific ligand, but in general each activates an intracellular ERK kinase. The present results show that intracellular regulators control the timing and strength of ERK activation and thus determine the specific cellular response to signaling by a given RTK. However, these regulators, or adaptors, are mostly unknown, and moreover, there is still no way to competently assess the specificity of a particular regulator for a particular RTK. If we could remove a particular RTK adaptor in all cells with active RTK signaling, then by comparing the rate of ERK kinase activation, we could determine for which RTK signaling a particular adaptor is specific. This knowledge would then greatly facilitate the development of drugs for diseases caused by mutations in RTKs, because drugs could be developed to act directly on the adaptor specific to a particular signalling pathway, thereby greatly reducing their side effects.

""Label-free"" cell cycle analysis is an interesting strategy, particularly because of its non-destructive nature and the elimination of the often misleading effect of fluorescent dyes. This project focuses in particular on dynamic changes in nuclear structure during cell division. Based on recent observations from live cell imaging, it has been found that some components of the nucleus (nuclear components without membrane) behave like phase-separated liquids. Imaging these compartments is complicated, but nevertheless possible using quantitative microscopy. Quantitative phase imaging produces large amounts of data that are usually analyzed manually or semi-automatically by an experienced operator. It turns out that deep learning methods can be successful in automatically analyzing such complex data with a high degree of precision and robustness."

In addition to exogenous factors, endogenous mechanisms also modulate CYP activity. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is one of the regulatory homeostatic mechanisms in health and disease and is involved in the hormonal and immune response of the organism, and its pleiotropic effects have not been studied in detail. This project aims to investigate the role of the ECS in regulating the activity of hepatic CYP enzymes. Changes in the activity, mRNA and protein levels of CYP, and changes in hormone levels will be monitored in rats following treatment with cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists and antagonists. Subsequently, their effect on human CYP will be investigated in models of primary hepatocytes, recombinant CYP and the effect on nuclear receptors involved in the regulation of CYP enzymes will be monitored. The results may have translational medical relevance as the ECS is a promising target for the action of many drugs in areas such as the treatment of pain, vomiting, spasticity, epilepsy or autoimmune diseases and CB receptor ligands may thus interfere with drugs metabolized by CYP.

FGFs exist as inherently unstable proteins, and their in vitro biological activity is severely limited by this instability. We hypothesize that the low stability of important FGF family morphogens, such as FGF8 and FGF10, has evolved as a mechanism that prevents uncontrolled FGF signaling during morphogenesis. In the proposed project, we will test this hypothesis by determining the effect of FGF stabilization on early mammalian limb development. Using rationally controlled mutagenesis, we will experimentally stabilize FGF8 and FGF10 proteins by increasing their resistance to heat denaturation and proteolytic degradation. The stabilizing mutations will then be introduced into mouse Fgf8 and Fgf10 in vivo by gene manipulation, thereby generating animal models expressing stable Fgf8 and Fgf10. We will then determine the effect of FGF8 and FGF10 stabilization on limb development in these models.

It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms of ageing and the genetic background of ageing. We have previously identified and described a novel tumor suppressor gene, TUSC3, in ovarian tumors that is part of the N-glycosylation enzyme complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TUSC3 affects the cell response pathway to the presence of unfolded proteins in the ER (UPR) and induces changes in cellular ultrastructure when ER homeostasis is disturbed (ER stress). The main objective of this project is to describe the association of TUSC3 with N-glycosylation processes in the ER and morphological changes in ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) during aging.

DrSc.;923;Partner;LF;Ústav veřejného zdraví;Most vertebrate cells have a primary cilia whose function is to integrate signaling pathways and mediate intercellular communication. A properly functioning cilia is an essential component of healthy development and aging in all ciliated organisms, including humans. Intestinal cell kinase (ICK) is a well-known and evolutionarily conserved regulator of primary cilia. Deletion of ICK or its homologs leads to deregulation of cilia length, and loss of kinase activity in humans leads to lethal skeletal ciliopathies and is associated with tumors. However, the molecular mechanism by which ICK regulates cilia is unknown. This project aims to elucidate this mechanism, which will lead to a deeper understanding of the origin and progression of ciliopathies and also contribute to the development of therapies for diseases caused by abnormal ICK function.

MUDr. Ph.D.;26544;Příjemce;LF;Klinika dětské neurologie;Malignant melanoma is an aggressive malignant tumour that rarely responds to standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Targeted therapy mainly focuses on the ERK kinase signaling pathway, which in most melanomas is activated by mutations in the BRAF or NRAS oncogenes. New BRAF inhibitors can slow the progression of the disease, but usually resistance to treatment develops. Our recently published results suggest the existence of a previously undescribed regulatory mechanism involving kinase suppressor of RAS (KSR) family proteins and controlled by the energy sensor AMPK, which actively modulates the oncogene-activated ERK pathway upon exposure to metabolic stress in melanoma cells. The present project will use proteomic approaches and molecular and cell biology methods to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which AMPK kinase regulates the interaction of KSR proteins with RAF kinases and the activity of the ERK pathway in melanoma cells. Understanding these novel mechanisms could lead to new treatment options for NRAS-mutated tumors and melanomas carrying the BRAF V600E mutation that have developed resistance to BRAF inhibitors.

Alterations in the structure and/or function of the TATS can be both a consequence and a cause of cardiac pathology, such as heart failure. Available methodological approaches for the analysis of the functional characteristics of TATS provide different results. Therefore, we have recently proposed a new method leaving the cell intact and allowing more accurate estimation of TATS characteristics. This method is based on a significant increase in the electrical resistance of TATS due to exposure of the measured cell to an isotonic solution with low conductivity. In the framework of this project, the new method will be detailed and published. Through this method, we will obtain new information on the functional characteristics of TATS in rat and human cardiac cells. Human cells will be isolated from hearts affected by heart failure and also from healthy heart tissue obtained during surgical procedures. The experimental data will be used to refine the description of TATS in mathematical models of cardiac cells in order to deepen the understanding of the influence of TATS on the electromechanical activity of cardiac cells.

Deficits in emotion regulation may manifest as a limited ability to regulate the intensity and duration of emotions, as a reduced ability to control the behavioural expression of emotions, or as the use of predominantly maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. This project examines the links between specific types of impaired emotion regulation and emotion and interoceptive awareness, dissociation, identity, impulsivity, and social cognition. This is a set of interrelated processes, many of whose relationships are not well documented in the existing literature. This study will focus on the validation of methods for measuring these constructs in the Czech language and the verification of their discriminant validity by administering the methods to three selected groups with deficits in emotion regulation.

Today it is known as the third gasotransmitter. In mammalian cells, endogenous H2S is produced by two cytosolic enzymes, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), and mitochondrial beta-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), which are expressed to varying degrees in many cells. A comprehensive understanding of the expression and function of CBS, CSE and MPST in cancer cells is still not fully elucidated. Based on the current knowledge, we hypothesized the following: the function of H2S-producing enzymes could be influenced by their localization and degree of compartmentalization, pH changes and oxidative state. Under hypoxia, endogenous H2S production and the function of H2S-producing enzymes could be affected. Thus, the main aim of this study is to describe the relationship between the localization, expression and function of individual H2S-producing enzymes in selected cancer cells. Understanding the mechanism of action of H2S during normoxia and hypoxia may provide new therapeutic strategies.

The mutation leads to the elongation of the polyglutamine chain over 36 repeats when translated. Huntingtin (HTT) is a protein with many functions, and its mutation is likely to lead to both the loss of some normal functions and the acquisition of the toxic effects of mutant HTT (mHTT). There is currently no therapy for HD, but the rapid development of new therapeutic approaches is mainly focused on reducing the amount of mHTT in the body. However, HTT also has an important role in embryogenesis and cell differentiation that is not fully understood and may play a role in later HD therapy. In the present project, we propose to use microscopic and proteomic methods to monitor human HD iPSC lines, compare them with their isogenic HTT null control lines and control iPSC lines with normal HTT, and observe their early and later neural differentiation. We expect to identify novel proteins and molecular mechanisms that will help elucidate the developmental phenotype of HTT in neural differentiation and thus in the development of HD.

Aberrant FGFR activation accounts for at least 20 conditions, including skeletal dysplasias, metabolic syndromes and cancer. Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a main mediator of FGFR signaling, but the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown. Our preliminary data point to a complex regulatory networks that operate at different subcellular levels to allow for prolonged ERK activation by FGFRs. These involve mechanisms regulating FGFR expression, FGFR interactions of their signaling intermediates, mechanisms governing FGFR turnover at the cell membrane, and negative feedback mechanisms involved in downregulation of the FGFR signal. In this project, we will describe the regulatory networks mediating prolonged activation of ERK pathway in major biological processes regulated by FGFRs. Unraveling the mechanisms regulating FGFR-ERK activation holds a key to our understanding of FGFR function and might aid identification of novel therapeutic targets for FGFR-related disorders.

Studies have shown that some inhaler types only effectively aerosolize 5-30% of the contained drug. The project MediAir focuses on which influencing physiological and mechanical characteristics exist and how they can be controlled to enlarge effectivity of inhalative drug delivery for individual situations. Based on current research, which is mainly based on in-vivo and in-silico models of the respiratory tract and the human respiration process, a considerable amount of provided drug components are not carried along to the intended site of impact within the respiratory tract. This leads to several deficits of this drug delivery method including situation-specific mostly uncomfortable breathing guidelines for the patients, loss of ineffective but valuable material, special considerations and additional components for children and elderly people. The investigative question focuses on the identification of the influencing parameters for effective drug delivery and how they may be tested to increase effectivity - leading to higher degree of comfort for the patients and less necessary drug components for the producing companies. The testing method will include the use of an actively breathing lung simulator xPULM (integrating multiple lung equivalents, for example also porcine lungs). Within the project, this simulator shall be refined from two perspectives. The mechanical setup will be advanced by including an upper airway model and changeable resistances, with focus on the physiological conditions during simulation including various breathing patterns, flow and pressure dependencies, based on analysed and annotated flow data from the included study population. The used aerosol production units will be characterised prior to the measurement cycles for particle analysis and reference measurements. The combination of realistic breathing patterns, with changeable lung equivalents, anatomically realistic lung simulation and physiological breathing conditions characterise the innovative approach of this project.

It has been proposed that mitochondria and mitochondrial metabolism are crucial in these processes and that the transfer of functional mitochondria from stromal cells to cancer cells leads to the recovery of OXPHOS metabolism in cells with damaged mitochondria, thus helping restore their tumor-initiating ability. Mitochondria transferred via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) were shown to alter the metabolism of recipient cells. This process has been reported between cancer cells, as well as between cancer cells and normal cells within the tumor. Therefore, a better understanding of this process is an important area of interest in cancer cell biology and cancer therapy.

Resistance to therapy, especially radiotherapy, is one of the main reasons for the low survival rate of patients. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for treatment resistance can have a significant impact on patient survival. Autophagy is one of the major cellular mechanisms of HNSCC tumor cells responsible for adaptation to stress and nutrient fluctuations. Autophagy is a catabolic process of recycling cellular proteins and whole organelles. This process is also closely linked to exosomal secretion. In this project, the effect of inhibition of autophagy at different stages of this process on exosome abundance and composition will be analyzed.

The basic hypothesis of the project is that the combination of these two methods (targeted sequencing of relevant genes and immunohistochemical determination of protein expression levels) will allow the use of the newly proposed molecular biological classification in clinical practice without the need for costly complex genomic sequencing. The aim is a more accurate pre-treatment classification of patients into prognostic groups according to the risk of disease recurrence than the current histological and aetiopathogenetic classification, which is inadequate and leads in many cases to underestimation of adjuvant therapy or, on the contrary, too radical treatment.

90267;1223/2019;Improvement of work with cofferdam and sectional matrices in practical training;Šikula Petr, MDDr.;410636;Příjemce;LF;Stomatologická klinika;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly population worldwide. It typically presents with two pathological features: 1) extracellular beta-amyloid plaques (Aβ) and 2) intraneuronal Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (P-Tau). However, clinical trials aimed at preventing the deposition of P-Tau or Aβ have not demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of AD. This suggests that protein aggregation is probably not the cause but rather the consequence of unknown mechanisms that ultimately lead to AD pathology. Recent studies show that age-induced senescence, associated with cellular stress and DNA damage, can lead to the induction of senescence-activated secretory phenotype (SASP), chronic inflammation and degenerative pathologies. Thus, this process could be the cause of AD. This project therefore aims to study the molecular mechanisms leading to the onset of the AD phenotype. We hypothesize that DNA damage and cellular stress are one of the initial triggering factors leading to the accumulation of Aβ oligomers. This is followed by the induction of cellular senescence in neurons and/or glia, which subsequently, via SASP production, leads to inflammation, neuronal loss and dementia. We believe that by combining samples from clinically and biomarker well-defined patients, appropriate analytical methods, a unique stem cell-based model of brain organoids, and strong expertise in neurodifferentiation, aging, and SASP, we will be able to identify novel factors that contribute to AD.

Therefore, to decipher new mechanisms that regulate MG development and cancer, unbiased approaches that include spatial information are required. In this project, we aim to develop a new protocol for spatial transcriptomics on MG organoids as a powerful tool for uncovering mechanisms that regulate breast development and cancer.

MUDr. Ph.D.;141920;Příjemce;LF;Klinika dětské ORL;Today, medical education in Ukraine is in the most cases focused on the acquisition and consolidation of a large amount of theoretical knowledge. Practical skills, which are an extremely important competence of doctors and medical staff, are spent to a lesser extent. The application of immersive reality will allow students to learn how to apply theoretical knowledge and to practice practical skills in situations that are as close to real as possible. Such training is especially important for developing emergency care. After all, crises in an unprepared person often cause a state of panic and stupor, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of assisting to even well-trained medical staff. The use of immersive reality in the complex of an innovative first aid course for medical students and nurses will help to better cope with crises and adequately assist the victims. It will also help future physicians to better understand the scope and stage of care.

The current body of research supports the concept that protein aggregation initiates the onset of Alzheimer's disease. However, in spite of a large number of available literature and studies, a mechanism of pathogenesis and potential treatment for AD remains elusive. Here we aim to evaluate the ""pathogen hypothesis"" of AD initiation. Using a model of patient-specific stem cell-derived cerebral organoids, we will test whether the infection by common pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Herpes virus type 1, induces the accumulation of amyloid-beta. Subsequently we will perform single-cell sequencing and analyze the pathogen-induced molecular changes connected to amyloid-beta accumulation. These results could possibly reveal novel insights into the mechanism of AD initiation and eventually lead to new ways of treatment of AD."

For decades, the primary cilium has been on the fringes of scientific interest. This has only changed in recent years when the study of this organelle has rightly become one of the most attractive areas of cell biology. The primary cilium functions as a cell surface antenna - it serves to transmit signals from the environment to the cell interior (Shh, Wnt, PDGF pathways), thus playing an indispensable role in the cellular response to environmental stimuli. The issue of cilium regulation is not only an ""academic problem"" but has a very important clinical aspect, as mutations in cilium components are associated with the development of many diseases and developmental defects. Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a key regulator of cilium formation (ciliogenesis) in vertebrates, and mutations in the TTBK2 gene are associated with the development of neurological disease in humans (spinocerebral ataxia type 11, SCA11). At present, it is not known exactly by what molecular mechanism TTBK2 regulates ciliogenesis and whether (and possibly how) its role in ciliogenesis is associated with the development of SCA11, i.e. whether it is a ciliopathy. The aim of this project will be to systematically compare ""wild type"" TTBK2 with mutant TTBK2 in several key parameters using several approaches (in vitro kinase essay, preparation of stable cell lines, study of ciliogenesis using cell models - RPE-1, HEK 293T). The data obtained, either at the molecular level (e.g. difference or not in the ability of wt and mutant TTBK2 to phosphorylate the tested substrate) or at the functional level (e.g. difference or not in the ability of wt and mutant TTBK2 to regulate ciliogenesis), can be expected to contribute to the elucidation of the role of TTBK2 in development and pathophysiology.

The aim of this project is to study the interactions of QBAs and their metabolites with non-canonical forms of DNA, such as the G-quadruplex or the i-motif. Stabilization of these structures can significantly affect the regulation of transcription and thus a number of pathophysiological processes, including carcinogenesis. QBAs to study these interactions will be isolated from natural sources and their metabolites will be prepared in sufficient quantities by biotransformation reactions (phase I and II metabolism) and isolated by semipreparative chromatography. Characterisation and identification will be performed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (MS). The interaction of QBA and their metabolites will be studied by spectrometric techniques (UV-Vis, fluorescence, circular dichroism, MS) and competitive dialysis. Highly interacting QBA representatives will be tested for cytotoxicity at the cellular level. By elucidating QBA interactions, the project will contribute to the potential use of QBAs as anticancer drugs."
84536;0707/2019;Optimization strategy for pulsed electrical ablation of cardiac arrhythmias;Jelínková Šárka, Mgr. Ph.D.;356972;Partner;LF;Biologický ústav;Mutations in RECQ4 helicase cause the Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. The disease is characterized by chromosome fragility, premature aging, developmental abnormalities and predisposition to cancer. RecQ4 participates in several cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA damage response, telomere and mitochondrial maintenance. However, it is not clear which impaired functions of RECQ4 trigger the pathogenic effects. We have identified several novel RecQ4 interacting partners mediated by the conserved N-terminal domain required for cell viability. Here we propose a multidisciplinary set of biochemical, biophysical, structural, cellular and genetic approaches to understand the molecular function of RecQ4 protein in cells and its correlation to disease development. We set three goals to unravel the roles of RecQ4 during replication and resolution of replication/recombination intermediates. Krejci's lab will focus on biochemical characterization of the above-mentioned protein interactions and their effect on replication initiation and progression, as well as resolution of stalled intermediates in human cell lines. Tripsianes' group will focus on structural and biophysical characterisation of interaction interfaces and identify separation of function mutants. Silva's team will nicely complement the biological role of RecQ4 in the C.elegans model system. The proposed synergy promises to dissect RecQ4 multiple functions in genome maintenance, which in turn will offer a better understanding on the development of RECQ4 associated diseases.

Ph.D.;150663;Partner;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;The interindividual variability in the stress perception and associated changes to the stress resilience can constitute a huge barrier to excellent performance in many highly stressful occupations. Even though there are methods available to measure the stress resilience, very few tools are available that would make it possible to reliably categorize a population based on the stress resilience of its individuals. This can have consequences especially in high stress situations such as combat scenarios, where it is only after the event where we are able to assess the resilience - however, to prevent the adverse outcome of the high-stress stimulus it is necessary to predict stress resilience before the event actually occurs. Overall, this project focuses on monitoring stress and stress resilience in various scenarios by by established physiological and psychological markers of stress and stress resilience as well as by our novel methodology for stress measurement. Moreover, the project will investigate the connection between neural activity and subjective as well as physiological markers of stress and stress resilience. The main goal of the study is to devise a method based on multiple layers of data (physiological markers of stress, neuroimaging, psychological data) making it possible to distinguish between more and less stress resilient individuals. We are convinced that such a method would have a far-reaching implication for the basic research, medicine, and various other applied fields, including space physiology.

Prolonged activation of ERK MAP kinase is a major mediator of aberrant FGFR3 signaling, but the molecular processes underlying this feature remain poorly characterized. A lack of coherent hypothesis explaining the mechanism of prolonged ERK activation in FGFR3 signaling complicates understanding of the molecular pathology of achondroplasia, and compromises development of treatment for this devastating human condition.

Within this population, poor muscle control, impaired balance and spasticity cause significant motor impairments. To improve locomotion, a surgery is the key part of treatment, whose success strongly depends on a correct surgery indication. However, the selection of the convenient surgery is very difficult and subjective also for expert surgeons. On the other hand, current motion capture systems can accurately measure kinematic, kinetic and spatio-temporal parameters of gait (so-called 3D motion data). A manual analysis of such complex data is practically impossible in huge data volumes. Within this project, we propose to develop a prototype software application for automatic analysis and evaluation of 3D motion data using sophisticated technologies employing artificial intelligence. In particular, we plan to utilize current advances in deep neural networks to learn a locomotion model from 3D motion data of thousands of gait cycles of more than 500 patients operated in the past. The learned model will be used to find formerly-operated patients with the most similar walking patterns. By considering the treatment outcome of these known patients, we could recommend the most suitable surgery option for a new examined patient. We assume that a sophisticated similarity analysis of a huge amount of 3D motion data can be the critical factor in distinguishing patients with a good response from patients with a poor response to a specific surgery, which is not possible to do in any other way at the present time. This project contributes to the healthcare of population (especially children aged 4-18) suffering from Cerebral Palsy and inherently requires a cooperation of experienced medical (MED MU) and technical (FI MU) institutions.

On the basis of appropriately selected model and largely typified cases from current forensic medical practice (gunshot injuries, falls from height, traffic accidents), factors involved in the development of real traumatic conditions of the human skeletal system will be studied, modelled and identified. A prerequisite for the study of the mechanism of injury will be a full-body examination of the cadaver (or the site of a specific injury) on a computed tomography scanner. The actual mathematical-physical modelling of the mechanism of trauma occurrence will be addressed by finite element analysis. These outputs will be confronted with the accompanying information of the case, with the real findings of the autopsy performed and with the conclusions of the radiological examination. The project will develop a radiological protocol for post-mortem whole-body examination of the human body using a dual-energy spectral computed tomography scanner, including readout of elemental composition information at the site of traumatic bone injury. This protocol will be further optimized for use in forensic injury modelling.

However, the influence of metal nanoparticles, frequently emitted to the environment by high temperature technological processes, is still hidden. The project is focused on the influence of inhaled nanoparticles of toxic lead and less toxic zinc compounds present in the urban aerosol on neural tissues, with focus on brain, olfactory epithelium and retina, their accumulation in these organs and mechanisms of their subsequent elimination from exposed organisms. Here, we will investigate lead and zinc nanoparticles clearance after their exposure by inhalation in whole body chambers. We will determine their distribution into different parts of neural tissues and submicroscopic changes caused by the nanoparticles in all target neural tissues, the speed of their clearance from selected organs and the ability of neural tissues to recover. Next, cellular mechanisms of nanoparticle clearance will be analyzed and we will test the hypothesis of ABC transporters as a key actors for metal nanoparticles efflux from cells. Moreover, we will develop and optimize new protocol for dual analysis of protein and element distribution in tissues to analyze direct effect of increased lead concentration on certain parts of organs. This new approach will enable us to correlate lead concentration to protein expression level. Our findings will expand our knowledge on the effects of inhaled toxic metal nanoparticles on organisms and will set grounds for designing strategies to support nanoparticles removal from organs in highly exposed urban areas.

Helping professions are important professions that aim to support the development of a person's personality (his or her education, health, social integration, mental and physical fitness, etc.). The high level of professional performance is ensured, among other things, by the interconnection of the professions with the scientific and study disciplines cultivated at universities - the link between them is the preparatory and continuing (lifelong) education of professionals. The professions are in transition - undergoing changes due to global trends, departmental policies, changes in science and technology and other influences. The factors driving these changes may differ from profession to profession, as may the content of these changes. In some areas of change there is a permeation of professions and in others new professions are emerging. The aim of the project is to identify the transitions that the helping professions are undergoing and to suggest how the changes might be reflected in related fields of study at MUNI or at universities in general. The research aims to capture how transitions change professions and the relationships between them (interprofessionalism) and how they enter into the relationships between disciplines (interdisciplinarity). In the first phase (2020), an analysis of transitions will be conducted, complemented by a study of the research literature on professions and fields of study. Subsequently (2021), the relationships between professions and disciplines will be studied using focus groups and the delphi method. In the third phase (2022), the results will be used to construct models (cases) capturing the relationships between professions and the corresponding fields of study and science; the problem of interprofessionalism and interdisciplinarity will be addressed through case studies. Academics from four MUNI faculties and practicing professionals will be involved in each phase. In extension of the cognitive goal of the research, the researchers' ambition is to draw proposals for conceptual, content, methodological, etc. adjustments to the preparatory and continuing education of professionals at universities. The project will enable the establishment of a professional platform on which it will be possible to confront current problems in higher education, such as academic failure, turnover and drop-out from the profession, weakening interest in further education, etc."

The aim of this project is to compare the accuracy and reliability of the detection of dominant abdominal wall perforators using color Doppler sonography and abdominal angio-CT with the actual location and size of the perforators excised."
84222;0681/2019;Multicentre evaluation of hypersensitivity reaction in patients indicated for total joint replacement including evaluation of reasons for reimplantation;Pávková Goldbergová Monika, prof. RNDr. Ph.D.;9447;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie;Radiological imaging is a routine part of the diagnosis of most oncological diseases. Advances in imaging methods have made more accurate and comprehensive cancer diagnosis and assessment of treatment response possible. In addition to saturation dynamics and densitometry, spectral CT offers new possibilities for characterization of lesions, which could contribute to a closer differential diagnosis of tumors, estimation of their histopathological subtypes, aggressiveness and prediction of treatment response. Another modern method is PET/MR. PET/MR can exclude early dissemination of cancer with very high sensitivity. Information from PET/MR in combination with spectral CT may provide further refinement of differential diagnosis of tumors with the ambition to distinguish clinically relevant histological subtypes. No less important progress has been made in the development of new MR sequences. In addition to standard native and post-contrast sequences, modern diffusion-based sequences (e.g. IVIM) can be used for the differential diagnosis of brain tumours in particular. The integration of the findings of these new diagnostic methods into the patient's therapeutic plan allows for the individualisation of procedures in modern cancer treatment.

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH), when indicated and administered correctly, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects - it alleviates undesirable secondary hypoxic processes and thus improves the overall prognosis of patients (reducing mortality and subsequent morbidity). Prediction of prognosis in terms of long-term motor and cognitive outcome of patients is limited (partly possible e.g. on the basis of dynamics of patterns in amplitude EEG). Therefore, the aim of the project is to search for another objective prognostic marker by means of advanced MR image processing methods highlighting hypoxia-specific patterns in individual images, especially in cases of ""MR-negative"" patients, i.e. where hypoxic changes are not clearly visible by visual analysis of conventional MR sequences."
83957;0656/2019;The role of NOS modulation of cardiac progenitor/resident cells in onset and progression of heart failure in Duchenne muscular dystrophy;Jelínková Šárka, Mgr. Ph.D.;356972;Příjemce;LF;Biologický ústav;Project A: Cortical excitability (KE) is the intensity of the neural response of cortical neurons to stimulation. Its elevated level is a key mechanism in some neurological diseases, including epilepsy, and sources suggest that it plays a role in the genesis of physiological déjà vu. Déjà vu is an anomalous memory phenomenon in which there is an inadequate sense of familiarity with a newly experienced situation. It occurs in the majority of the healthy population, but also as a concomitant phenomenon of mesotemporal epilepsy. In these disorders, KE and structural changes in the hippocampus dominate. A similar pattern of structural and metabolomic changes in the temporal lobes has been identified in our previous studies in healthy subjects with déjà vu. The present project is designed to increase knowledge about the role of KE in the genesis of déjà vu in healthy subjects and epileptic patients in response to visual stimulation. The knowledge gained will lead to a better understanding of excitatory balance in healthy individuals and patients with neurological diseases.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI-AN) is an early stage of AN. Dementia in AN negatively impacts the quality of life of the patient and caregiver and is associated with a significant increase in morbidity/mortality. In this project we will investigate the neural correlates of memory impairment in patients with MKP-AN. MRI brain imaging combined with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIMS) - repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), serves as another tool to uncover mechanisms of cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Using NIMS, we can induce changes in brain plasticity and function that can further lead to therapeutic effects on cognitive function.

More than half of patients with PN develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI-PN) over time. These patients have a higher risk of dementia. PN is incurable, but symptoms can be suppressed and its development slowed. Currently, there is a lack of an early specific neuroimaging biomarker for PN. Animal studies show the potential of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). DKI is useful for the assessment of microstructural changes such as pathological protein accumulation. Finding a specific, early and non-invasive marker of PN would allow for early diagnosis, initiation of treatment and improvement of patients' quality of life.

Using data from the Brno Growth Study (BGS), which followed participants from prenatal stages of development through adulthood and regularly collected a wealth of anthropometric, behavioral, and biochemical data, including hair samples, we will focus on the following three objectives. First, to assess changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) function in early life by analyzing cortisol from hair samples collected at birth and three other time points during the first year of life. Second, to assess the relationships between these changes in HPA axis function in early life and health, growth, and cognition in childhood and adolescence. Finally, we will focus on neuroimaging and behavioral monitoring of a subset of BGS participants in their 60s to assess relationships in HPA axis function during early life and behavior in older adulthood. This interdisciplinary research using a unique longitudinal cohort study bridges the fields of anthropology, medicine, and neuroscience and offers unprecedented breakthroughs into the long-term health consequences of early life stress exposure.

The group of primary intracranial tumours includes, among others, the most prevalent primary brain tumours - glial tumours and the most common primary tumours of the meninges - meningiomas. In our previous projects, we have investigated various histopathological parameters (cellularity, vascularity, proliferative potential) in glioblastoma, which is the most common high-grade tumour among the group of primary intracranial tumours. We correlated these parameters with parameters on MRI (ADC) and found that ADC values can predict the histological nature of the tumor and the extent of infiltration. In the continuation of our project, we plan to extend our analysis to include other tumor parameters by MR, such as assessing the ratio of the extent of necrosis to the post-contrast hem, or volumometry and correlating these with histological assessment of the ratio of necrosis to viable tumor tissue and relating them to clinical data on survival and time to disease progression. We plan to further focus on other primary brain tumors, especially low-grade glial tumors and meningiomas. In the retrospective part of the analysis, we will then explore the possibility of predicting glial tumor recurrence based on imaging or histological characteristics. We will also focus on the comparison of methods for investigating the presence of IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutation, which is one of the most important prognostic factors in glial tumors - the presence of this mutation significantly improves prognosis.

It further develops and builds on project 1586/2018 and other projects of similar focus addressed in the past years (metronomic and anti-angiogenic therapy, individualized therapy). The project is in line with the latest trends in contemporary oncology, i.e. personalized therapy or ""precision oncology"".  Personalized treatment procedures are based on a detailed examination of the specific disease, its evolution over time (repeated biopsies and biological analysis) and the genetic background of the patient. Both commercially available and ""in-house"" academic approaches based on molecular biology technologies are used for this purpose. The data are subjected to sophisticated bioinformatic analysis, which forms an integral part of these so-called theranostic approaches.   As part of this approach, we perform analyses of biological material that include transcriptional profiling, detection of receptor tyrosine kinase and MAP kinase phosphorylation by proteomic methods, and next-generation whole exome/genome sequencing (NGS) and detection of specific translocations/gene fusions (RNAseq). The panel of assays was expanded in 2019 to include methylome sequencing. Later this year, the testing of cell free DNA mutations from patient plasma is also planned to start.  The comprehensive information obtained is evaluated in the context of regular expert meetings - the so-called expert panel (""molecular tumor board""), on the basis of which a specific treatment recommendation is made. The long-term goal is to improve treatment outcomes for patients with high-risk cancers such as children with refractory and relapsed solid tumours and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). This can be achieved precisely by personalized approaches within the theranostic principle, as demonstrated by our published results. Based on our experience, the personalized treatment principle can be applied in approximately 60% of the patients considered. The aim of the project is to comprehensively develop the theranostic principle and its application in children with high-risk cancer and thus improve the success rate of treatment. Emphasis is also placed on repeated examinations of the tumor tissue of the same patient (repeated biopsies at recurrences/progressions, clonal development) and follows the latest trends in oncology (procedures such as ""liquid dynamic medicine"" and ""N-of-1 clinical trials"")."

A complementary, and equally important, part of the diagnosis is the investigation of intracardiac signals during the actual electrophysiological examination, allowing the precise identification of the site of arrhythmia origin in the cardiac musculature. At present, the analysis of intracardiac signals is performed only in the time domain, i.e. measuring and comparing signals, creating ""local activation time"" maps, etc... Signal analysis in the spectral domain is therefore offered as another possible method to effectively diagnose arrhythmias of both the ""re-entry"" type and especially arrhythmias of a focal nature."

However, the safe and effective use of any stem cell type is completely dependent on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence stem cell behavior, our ability to control the differentiation of stem cells into functional somatic cell types, or our ability to generate and influence the three-dimensional arrangement of stem and progenitor cells. The specific research project will build on our previous investigations and address topics relevant to these fundamental needs. In particular, (i) the molecular mechanisms responsible for genetic instability and genetic modifications of human embryonic stem (hES) cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells will be studied, (ii) methods for isolation and characterization of the extracellular matrix and their impact on stem and progenitor cells will be tested, and (iii) microfluidic systems will be developed to coculture multiple types of stem and progenitor cells, (iv) the involvement of miRNA molecules in controlling differentiation and establishing stem cell plasticity will be investigated, (v) methods for forming 3D cell aggregates and differentiating them into specific tissue types will be developed, and (vi) protocols for differentiating hES cells into relevant cell types, particularly lung epithelial and neural lineages, will be further developed. The main experimental approaches will be in vitro manipulation of cells, imaging of live and fixed cells with advanced microscopy techniques, and quantification of relevant mRNAs and proteins for molecular phenotyping of cell populations.

Minimally invasive surgery is a clear trend and the percentage of surgeries performed endoscopically, minimally invasively, is increasing dramatically. However, in contrast to conventional surgery by the surgeon's hands, the mobility of endoscopic instruments is still limited. This can lead to technical limitations in the feasibility of some of the tasks required for successful completion of the operation endoscopically during a long and complex operation. Robotic systems that convert the surgeon's hand movements into highly mobile instruments using computer algorithms have made a contribution to endoscopic surgery. However, these very precise systems are very costly, both in terms of acquisition and subsequent operating costs. However, advances in current technology already allow miniaturization of instruments and therefore commercially available robotic instruments are being developed that are held in the hand by the surgeon and the robotic movement is directly controlled by his fingers. These systems are simple to use, affordable with minimal operating costs and compact compared to a robotic system. That is why we consider their introduction in our clinic a privilege in the Czech Republic and we plan to extend their introduction into routine surgery to young surgeons, to seek their widest possible use in daily practice and to cooperate with technology companies to improve them.

Together with the acquisition of a record during the examination of the patient by administering the substance indocyanine green (ICG), the degree of blood supply to the tissue of the digestive tube during the surgical procedure can be determined very precisely. Establishing an accurate correlation between these two methods is then essential for the use of thermography in the field of gastrointestinal surgery. The results obtained during surgical procedures will thus significantly complement the database of already measured data. According to the literature, the comparison of the two methods was only experimentally observed.

MUDr. Ph.D.;37338;Příjemce;LF;I. interní kardioangiolog. klinika;"The oxygen reserve index (ORi) is a new non-invasive method of assessing oxygenation in patients. It is a fingertip sensor, similar to that used to measure pulse oximetry (SpO2). However, unlike SpO2, it gives information about a certain ""oxygen reserve"", or level of hyperoxia. The ORI value correlates with the PaO2 value obtained by blood gas analysis. In anaesthesiology, it is desirable to induce a certain level of hyperoxia prior to the introduction of CA and is routinely performed in the form of so-called preoxygenation. It is empirically known that some patient groups (pulmonary pathology, obesity) require a different form of preoxygenation, e.g.: preoxygenation with a sealing mask, longer preoxygenation time, higher flow rate of the inspired mixture, use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), etc. A continuously measured ORI value could quantify and optimize the preoxygenation procedure in different patients. Conversely, in intensive care, hyperoxia is considered undesirable. Therefore, in patients requiring oxygen therapy or artificial pulmonary ventilation, we check the level of hyperoxia by blood gas analysis (astrup). We hypothesize that continuous measurement of ORI would allow us to respond more flexibly to the presence of hyperoxia in patients and therefore more quickly adjust the level of oxygen therapy administered and thus reduce the number of blood draws (for astrup) in ICU patients."

MUDr. Ph.D.;1188;Partner;LF;Fyziologický ústav;Surveillance and assistive devices for patients with neurocognitive deficits (e.g. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc.) currently represent a great potential for innovation and hope to help them cope with their illness and maintain a full life. At the same time, the application of technology also poses significant social and user risks. The project aims to analyse both the context of development and the conditions for the most appropriate application of these aids, as well as to sociologically describe the potential pitfalls of misuse and the degree of unsolicited social control in the environment of contemporary personalised and commercialised medicine. From a sociological point of view, it is necessary to pay close attention to the processes of application of new technologies and devices, including ethical issues. The project addresses the topics of autonomy and decision-making about the right way of coping with living with neurocognitive deficits with new technical devices, as well as the topic of unequal opportunities for beneficiaries and care providers to participate in the strategy of their own treatment, which is still poorly reflected in the Czech context. The project focuses on a sociological analysis of the everyday life of patients with Alzheimer's disease and on the identification of types of technological aids for patients that both help them to be in control of their disease and that minimally interfere with their personal autonomy and bodily integrity when using them. It will also focus on minimising the social stigma of visible assistive and compensatory devices. The research should also identify the requirements of medical and patient assistance and establish criteria for comfortable use of the aids, which will be developed and tested over the course of the project. Emphasis will be placed on feedback from users regarding the functions of the technology so that the electronic device optimally (in character, shape, control, signals, colour) suits the care recipients as an assistive and monitoring aid. The analysis and collaboration on the development and testing of this technology will then result in the design of a unique assistive device that will make life easier for patients and the surrounding stakeholders involved in their treatment (family, assistants, doctor).

In previous periods, recommended practices in the care of people with non-healing wounds were developed and implemented. A large-scale survey was conducted on the process of assessing non-healing wounds in clinical practice (in acute inpatient care providers, home care and social service departments). Subsequently, the causes of sororigenic wounds and the psychometric properties of scales for assessing the risk of pressure lesions were evaluated. Previous projects have highlighted gaps in the assessment of non-healing wounds and the lack of erudition of health professionals in direct care in wound management and identification. In previous projects, particular attention was paid to decubital lesions as the most common non-healing wounds. In 2019, attention has already been paid to other non-pressure wounds (parchment skin, incontinent dermatitis) as well as the cost of their prevention and care. The project implemented in 2019 is a multicentre observational descriptive study with interventional elements aimed at the validation and clinical use of new objectifying scales for wound assessment (GLOBIAD and ISTAP). In 2020, the project activities would continue smoothly. The project activities build on the professional activities of the project guarantor (member of the CSLR committee, EWMA committee, EPUAP committee). The project objectives include increasing the professional competence of general nurses in wound management in critical care. The project will be continued as a multidimensional one, linking specific areas of wound care (prevention, differential diagnosis and wound management in IP) in conditions of so-called unprovided or unrealized care. Based on project activities, relevant data are collected, epidemiological assessment in specific care providers. in 2020, 2 more DSP students will be involved in the project.

Simulation scenarios with an emergent care theme can be a useful tool to help simulation participants become accustomed to making quick and correct clinical decisions, be able to build thought patterns of differential diagnosis and critical thinking, gain orientation to stressful situations, and learn to collaborate and communicate within an interdisciplinary team, while the simulation scenario allows for immediate feedback on participant performance. The adult learning model emphasises that it is personal experience (hands-on experience), deliberate practice of theoretical knowledge and correctly given feedback that benefit the participants. Although simulation cannot replace clinical practice experience, it can be an excellent tool for gaining experience without compromising patient safety.The medical errors and suboptimal care factors identified in the simulation scenarios of postgraduate participants are repetitive in nature and can be used as observed learning outcomes for undergraduate clinical teaching.

In paediatric patients, limited data are available regarding tidal volume size and it is recommended to follow a tidal volume of ˂10ml/kg for the entire age spectrum of paediatric patients. The aim of this retrospective observational study is to evaluate tidal volume size in clinical practice in paediatric patients during general anaesthesia and during intensive care stay. In addition, the setting of the end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) value in relation to the inspiratory fraction of oxygen (FiO2) and the so-called modified driving pressure (peak pressure - end-expiratory pressure) in patients undergoing general anaesthesia with artificial lung ventilation versus patients on artificial lung ventilation in intensive care will be investigated. Data will be analyzed retrospectively.

For adults, romantic partners are one of the most important social regulators of negative emotions, and experimental studies have shown that partner presence dampens emotional distress and neural reactivity during physical threat and pain. However, the modulating effects of social support during exposure to emotional visual stimuli and emotional imagery are still largely unexplored. Negative emotional imagery and exposure to grief-inducing visual material cause subjective stress and can compromise quality of life. Intrusive mental imagery is further prevalent in patients with mood and anxiety disorders and therefore has been given increasing scientific attention. Both peripheral and central neurophysiological underpinnings of negative imagery and whether these can be modulated has captured interest. Previous studies have used physical threats to induce discomfort, but during ordinary everyday life fantasies and images of aversive situations and outcomes are common and therefore in this project we aimed to study aversive mental imagery and exposure to visual reminders of deceased close person, and the effects of social support given by the attachment figure (romantic partner) and a stranger, on brain activity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), in order to assess the brain function at various levels. Such research is warranted in order to investigate brain reactivity and functional connectivity, that are specific for negative imagery and exposure to negative personal visual material and whether social support by a close person can modulate such potentially deleterious neural activity to this type of stressors. The findings can provide new leads in understanding possible health benefits stemming from social interactions and deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of attachment. GAMU grant support will provide us with resources needed in order to finalize the research project in presenting our findings in leading journals in the field.

Hearing defects affect 1:1000 physiological newborns and 20-40:1000 pathological newborns. Compared to other childhood diseases that are picked up by full-body screening, such as phenylketonuria (1:4500 newborns) or hypothyroidism (1:4000 newborns), this is a very common disability with far-reaching consequences. Up to 60% of hearing defects are congenital, occurring during the first trimester of pregnancy, and 40% are acquired. A child with a hearing loss is at risk of delayed psychomotor development, limited learning ability, difficulties in integrating into society, and problems in entering the labour market later in life. Modern medicine is constantly looking for ways to adequately rehabilitate hearing. The aim of the project is to monitor the effectiveness and compare different options of hearing rehabilitation (cochlear implants, hearing aids, BAHA, middle ear implants) in children of different ages and with different types of hearing loss. The project builds on the results of the 2019 research.

Unfortunately, there has been no improvement in the survival of patients with HNSCC due to the lack of markers of therapeutic response and the emergence of treatment resistance. Resistance may be significantly promoted by tumor-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which secrete factors that enable tumor cell survival. Many are contained in exosomes. Exosomes released from CAFs in the tumor microenvironment may enhance tumor cell invasive behavior and resistance. Many types of RNA have been shown to be present within exosomes. In this project, we aim to investigate the RNA content of exosomes produced by CAFs using next-generation sequencing. We want to test the relevance of exosomal RNAs as biomarkers for clinically relevant characteristics of HNSCC patients indicated for surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, we would like to establish a panel of exosomal RNAs that can be detected in patients' venous blood that reflect the presence of a malignant tumor and a therapy-resistant phenotype.

It compares the standard method of guiding PCI under X-ray imaging control using a small amount of contrast agent with a non-contrast method using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to guide PCI. The project plans to enroll 30 patients with indications for elective PCI and renal function with eGFR<50ml/min/1.73m2, randomized 1:1. The primary objective of the project is to compare the evolution of renal parameters after intervention at the time of hospitalization and then at 1-year follow-up. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, defined as recurrent myocardial infarction, newly initiated dialysis treatment or unplanned target artery revascularization) is assessed. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of performing the procedure using IVUS compared with standard PCI guided by radiographic control is analyzed. Patients are planned to be followed up for 1 year after PCI.

Bc. Ph.D.;18469;Partner;LF;Ústav soudního lékařství;Solid bone fusion is a prerequisite for the treatment of a wide range of spinal disorders. The condition requires a graft containing organic and inorganic elements to achieve fusion. The autograft of a healthy individual carries an ideal ratio of biophysical properties expressed by the capacity for osteoinduction, osteoconduction and osteogenesis. With increasing age and comorbidities, the ideal ratios disappear and the harvest itself is further burdened by morbidity. At the same time, graft quantity decreases. All allogeneic and arteficial replacements combine biophysical conditions with suppression of osteogenesis. Worldwide data point to the potential of cell therapy. The experimental developments contained in this project combine the development of a three-dimensional porous carrier with appropriate physical properties with the application of human mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial precursors, in order to design and validate in vitro and subsequently in vivo in a small animal the production of an ideal living - bio-artificial - osteogenic carrier with therapeutic potential to effectively induce solid intervertebral fusion.

Current methods for detecting hair cortisol levels are very effective in determining acute levels, but fail in determining chronic cortisol levels. An alternative may be the determination of cortisol in the hair matrix - a single hair sample may cover a longer time interval of cortisol production and deposition in the body. Thus, hair cortisol levels can contribute significantly to improving diagnosis and treatment, particularly in patients on replacement therapy or with ectopic ACTH production. They can also be used for patient monitoring or retrospective determination of disease progression. Since no long-term marker of cortisol production is available, analysis of hair cortisol by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry could help to improve the overall status of hypercortisolism patients.

In many cases of solid tumors, a so-called metabolic symbiosis occurs, where the lactate produced by fibroblasts is a source of carbon for tumor cells. The lactate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 are functional biomarkers of metabolic symbiosis in various types of solid tumors, including head and neck tumors. This project will study the metabolic symbiosis between tumor cells and associated fibroblasts and its impact on the prognosis of HNSCC patients. Patient tumor tissue will be histologically processed for MCT detection, cocultured with FaDu cell line to assess the impact of the patient line on invasiveness and metastasis, and the effect of coculture on MCT and other genes associated with metabolic symbiosis will be assessed at the expression and protein level. The contribution of oxidative and glycolytic metabolism will be measured in the patient cell line. Based on these experiments, it will be possible to determine metabolic profiles associated with favorable/unfavorable prognosis, which may represent a major advance towards personalized therapy.

The increased risk of CVD may also be due to a different body composition with a higher proportion of body fat in psoriasis patients compared to the healthy population. White adipose tissue produces a number of agents, detectable even in the periphery, which may also be involved in autoimmune inflammation in psoriasis and may increase the risk of associated diseases. Using comparative non-targeted proteomics methods, we will identify circulating adipose tissue-associated molecules that will allow assessment of psoriatic inflammation and estimation of risk of associated diseases. Selection of appropriate adipose tissue-derived biomarkers will allow early assessment of CVD risk and may also contribute to an individualized treatment approach and reduce the risk associated with inappropriate treatment strategies. This approach is not currently available in dermatology, and the eventual development of a diagnostic kit for early detection of cardiovascular risk will benefit patients.

The presumed pathological mechanism of AEA is Th2 lymphocyte-mediated inflammation and, among others, reduced function of IL-10-producing induced T regulatory cells (iTreg) and increased serum gelatinase B (MMP9) levels. The iTregs are generated during CD4+ T cell activation, which is also influenced by intracellular complement. Pharmacologically, vitamin D may further influence this activation. The project is focused on monitoring CD46, C3aR, C5aR receptors in iTreg, their influence by vitamin D in vitro in patients with AEA. IL-10 production of iTreg obtained by anti-CD3 + anti-CD46 stimulation will also be monitored using culture experiments, as well as MMP9 production in supernatants of stimulated cells. Increased MMP9 concentration decreases CD46 expression and thus iTreg activity along with IL-10 production. Vitamin D, on the other hand, increases IL-10 production and restores iTreg function, which could lead to amelioration of immune system reactivity in AEA patients.

The cause of their formation is not completely clear and current treatments have only limited effect. Moreover, the diagnosis of FCD tends to be problematic due to the normal MRI of patients. miRNA is a regulator of gene expression and is also essential for the proper development of neural precursors during corticogenesis. Since affected tissues have different miRNA profiles, a complete miRNA analysis could reveal affected biochemical pathways involved in the development of FCD. The aim of our project is to analyze miRNA expression in FCD-affected tissues and find differentially expressed miRNAs. These miRNAs may be candidates for biomarkers that detect FCD and may also reveal biochemical pathways that contributed to the development of FCD.

MUDr. Ph.D.;45693;Partner;LF;Interní hematol.a onkol.klinika;Over the past few decades, there has been a significant shift in the treatment options available for patients with non-specific inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and an increase in knowledge about this group of diseases. This is a group of diseases whose course is highly heterogeneous, with a full spectrum of manifestations and variable degrees of disease aggressiveness. Early diagnosis of patients with potentially severe IBD is a major challenge. Although criteria for estimating the adverse prognosis of patients are available, they are not sufficient for reliable and accurate estimation of disease progression or treatment response. Some patients with unfavourable prognostic factors do not eventually develop severe symptoms, whereas the situation may be reversed in patients with an initially favourable prognosis. The demand for accurate and non-invasive biomarkers is high as they could help to characterize patients and personalize treatment more quickly, easily and effectively.Recently, epigenetic and regulatory mechanisms have been described in the pathogenesis of many diseases, in particular the role of short non-coding RNAs ( microRNAs). These molecules have been studied as potential biomarkers because of their unique properties as they are easily detectable in tissues and body fluids, are highly tissue and time specific, and their levels are measurable by established laboratory techniques. Some miRNAs have been shown to be associated with ileal and colonic Crohn's disease in adult patients, or to be able to distinguish patients with ulcerative colitis from those with Crohn's disease, yet their role and function in both adult and pediatric IBD patients remains poorly understood. Our study focuses on the global profiling of miRNAs in pediatric IBD patients and subsequent comparison of expression profiles in different subgroups of these patients, both with different diagnoses (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and with different severity of the disease itself or response to treatment. The aim is to create diagnostic, prognostic or predictive miRNA panels that could be used to diagnose patients with poorer prognosis or treatment response early, while on the other hand not unnecessarily burdening patients with a more prognostically favourable form of IBD with unnecessary treatments with many potential side effects. With the knowledge gained, it would be possible to improve both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

MUDr. Ph.D., MBA;185124;Příjemce;LF;Gynekologicko-porodnická klinika;Inflammatory changes in the brain represent one of the main factors in the development of pharmacoresistance in epilepsy of various etiologies and may directly potentiate neuronal excitability. Understanding the complex role of inflammation in the generation of epilepsy and the development of pharmacoresistance is essential to identify novel molecular targets that could be applied in the treatment of these patients. The main aim of this project is to test whether pro-inflammatory microRNAs, cytokines and chemokines are associated with the development of epileptic seizure drug resistance and status epilepticus in children. For this purpose, we will analyze levels of pro-inflammatory microRNAs, cytokines and chemokines in cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma in children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and refractory status epilepticus. To date, only a few similar studies have been conducted, and these have been performed in experimental animal models. The expected benefit of this study is to improve treatment options and prognosis in children with epilepsy.

MUDr. Ph.D.;24063;Jiný účastník;LF;Farmakologický ústav;Children with high-risk and relapsed solid tumours represent 15-20% of children with cancer, in whom we cannot reverse the adverse course of their disease. New treatment options and strategies must be sought for these patients. An essential condition for effective therapy is not only a detailed histopathological characterization of the tumor, but also adequate molecular biological testing. Several types of aberrations may be present in the tumor and contribute to the development of cancer. These include minor substitutions, amplifications of oncogenes or deletions of tumor suppressor genes, or upregulated expressed genes. All these events can be identified by modern methods based on next-generation sequencing. Some of the changes thus detected represent potential therapeutic targets, others are important prognostic factors. The overall goal of the project is to use whole-exome sequencing, low-coverage genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing as important diagnostic tools for the development of individualized treatment plans for children with high-risk solid tumors.

It is characterized by slow growth with the ability to metastasize, especially to the lungs. Chondrosarcomas of the axial skeleton with a high degree of malignancy have the worst prognosis. As it is a chemoresistant and radioresistant tumor, the success of treatment is determined only by the radicality of the primary surgery. The prognosis of patients with inoperable tumor is infaustive. Some types of cartilaginous tumors contain mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. These mutations may be related to the dedifferentiation of cartilaginous tumors and thus the prognosis of patients. Differentiating chondrosarcoma from the chondroblastic variant of osteosarcoma is difficult but essential for therapeutic management. A positive isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation result strongly favours the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. Targeting these metabolic pathways could be a new strategy in the treatment of inoperable or metastatic chondrosarcomas.

For multicentre production, standardisation of individual production centres, donor testing, source material and products is necessary. Drugs produced in different facilities from the same source must be compared not only according to release criteria but also in terms of safety and efficacy.  For clinical trials, it is essential to standardise testing of patients for viral load and for the presence and functionality of virus-specific T cells. It is also necessary to differentiate endogenous CMV-specific T cells from cells administered as drug from another donor (CMV-specific chimerism). For the different types of tests, it has to be determined whether it is more convenient to perform them locally through a network of mutually validated laboratories or centrally in one laboratory. Our aim is therefore to establish criteria and infrastructure for multicentre production of CMV-specific T-lymphocytes and for subsequent multicentre studies, which has not been done in Europe or the USA so far.

MUDr. Ph.D.;24063;Jiný účastník;LF;Farmakologický ústav;Infection affecting the root canal of the tooth is the most common cause of apical periodontitis (AP). Chronic inflammation in the periodontium can lead to the development of radicular cyst (RC), which belongs to the inflammatory odontogenic cysts (OC). Another group of OCs is developmental, which includes follicular cyst (FC) and odontogenic keratocyst (OKC). A classification of OCs that reflects their aetiopathogenesis and includes genetic factors is essential for optimal choice of therapy and patient management. The aim of this project is to determine the risk factors for OC development and improve their diagnosis. The project includes studies of the root canal microbiome and OC of inflammatory origin, genetic association studies focusing on the immune profile of patients and genes involved in odontogenesis, comparative studies of gene expression profiles in different types of OC, and studies of selected molecular pathways in the pathogenesis of OC in an animal model. Based on the results obtained, we will attempt to propose a panel of markers for the prediction of OC formation and their differential diagnosis.

Successful healing of the anastomosis is crucial for the postoperative course, otherwise serious complications arise. It is therefore necessary to meet several conditions during surgery for good healing of the anastomosis. The most important is excellent blood supply to the connected ends of the digestive tube. At present, the only objective method to determine the blood supply is indocyanine green (ICG). This is an imaging test that captures near-infrared radiation emitted by a fluorescent substance administered intravenously. Non-contact thermography (IRT), on the other hand, is a non-invasive, repeatable imaging method that does not require the administration of intravenous dyes, which can cause allergic reactions, and the acquisition and operating costs are significantly lower compared to ICG. The prerequisite for the usefulness of IRT in the assessment of blood flow is the depiction of the temperature drop of the poorly perfused segment of the digestive tube and the necessity to remove this part from the body and therefore the impossibility of using it for anastomosis.

In addition to genetic factors, inflammatory damage to the myocardium (myocarditis) is involved. Patients with evidence of myocardial inflammation have better recovery of left ventricular function and thus evidence of myocardial inflammation is an important prognostic factor for further development of left ventricular function. The gold standard for the demonstration of myocardial inflammation is invasive investigation - endomyocardial biopsy. The benefit of non-invasive imaging methods is less convincing. Identification of a new plasma biomarker would allow better estimation of further development of left ventricular function and patient prognosis. In our pilot study, we identified two groups of plasma proteins that predicted recovery of left ventricular function with high sensitivity and specificity in patients with newly diagnosed DKMP. The current project focuses on the role of imaging in the clinical part and in the laboratory part is a continuation and extension of our pilot analyses.

It is a malignant solid tumor, 90% diagnosed before the age of 5 years. Most localized forms are treated with surgery or in combination with chemotherapy. New therapies in recent years include the use of modified NK cells and gamma-delta T cells, which are highly reactive to NBL tumor cells in in vitro studies. The aim of this project is cellular and molecular analyses of immune cell populations in patients at diagnosis and during treatment, including functional essays of their interactions with tumor cells. An important goal of the project is a detailed study of the tumor microenvironment in different groups of NBL patients, namely myeloid suppressor cells, regulatory T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Our pilot results show significant expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes, their reactivity to NBL tumor cell lines including secreted exosomes. This study will contribute to elucidate key molecules of cellular interactions and help design clinical interventions for NBL tumor microenvironment.

The incidence and prevalence of FS is increasing steadily due to increasing life expectancy, higher success rates in the treatment of heart disease, but also due to the higher incidence of obesity and other metabolic risk factors associated with the occurrence of FS. FS is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, mainly due to heart failure and stroke. Catheter ablation, consisting of isolation of the pulmonary veins, is currently the most effective treatment for FS.  Observational studies show that a significant intervention targeting FS risk factors such as weight reduction, alcohol intake and increased physical activity is also associated with significantly higher sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance. A direct comparison of the two methods has not yet been performed. The purpose of this project is to compare in a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial catheter ablation vs. risk factor modification on SR maintenance (monitored continuously by ECG rheval) and on progression of left ventricular fibrosis.

Our pilot study in patients with ""true"" idiopathic VF revealed several gene variants associated with familial electrical heart disease, specifically KCNH2 and RYR2. As part of this project, we plan to perform genetic analysis in our existing patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic KF as well as newcomers. The mutational analysis will mainly focus on the major genes for LQTS, CPVT and BrS (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, RYR2). The functional analysis will look at the impact of three variants selected from those identified so far, two variants in the KCNH2 gene (S1021Qfs*98 and A228V) and a variant in the RYR2 gene (Y4734C). None of these have been functionally tested so far. One additional variant will be selected later, from variants identified in future patients. Dysfunction will be characterized by measuring ion currents using whole cell patch clamp technique, calcium imaging and/or confocal microscopy on human ion channels expressed on cell line and on cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells. In addition to in vitro functional analysis, in silico mathematical modeling will be used using a previously published human ventricular cell model. The main objective of the analysis will be to consider the pathogenicity of the identified selected variants, to reveal the underlying arrhythmogenic mechanism and potential provoking factors that may induce CF in otherwise asymptomatic carriers."

The aim of this study will be to evaluate the accumulation of [68Ga]-SomaKIT-TOC radiopharmaceutical in patients after meningioma extirpation in the skull base region, where the extent of resection does not exclude possible residual tumor cells. The results will then be volumetrically compared with the saturation findings after contrast agent administration on MRI in an attempt to verify the higher sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT [68Ga]-SomaKIT-TOC scanning in differentiating residual meningioma tumor tissue from postoperative changes. This is an open - non-randomized, single arm, non-comparative phase II clinical trial. The trial is designed to enroll 30 subjects who have been followed at the Department of Neurosurgery, St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno for WHO G I - III meningioma in the skull base region since 2000. The clinical trial will not include patients in whom the complete tumour with the surrounding hard tissue and bone was clearly removed to a sufficient extent, i.e. those with the resection extent assessed as Simpson grade I. The results of the accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical [68Ga]-SomaKIT-TOC after a single administration at individual time intervals from the administration of the radiopharmaceutical and the calculated RT/B ratio values will be recorded in tables. The monocentric clinical trial will be conducted only in the Czech Republic and in one centre, St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno.

The mechanism of their occurrence is unknown. The increased susceptibility to atrial and ventricular fibrillation could be due, among other things, to the effect of these drugs on the cardiac inward rectifier (Kir) potassium currents, which are known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrillation. Our pilot data showed that small changes in Kir currents caused by sildenafil or aminophylline at clinically relevant concentrations were enhanced in the presence of the environmental contaminant barium already at low concentrations. Therefore, in addition to the effect of these substances alone, a study of the combined effect in the presence of other Kir channel influencing substances, in particular barium at normal plasma concentrations as well as the addictive substances ethanol and nicotine, is planned. Experiments will be performed using the whole cell patch clamp technique on isolated rat and human cardiac cells and on human Kir channels expressed in a cell line. The impact of the observed changes in Kir currents on the complex electrical activity of cardiac cells will be studied both experimentally (current clamp recording of action voltages on isolated rat and human cardiac cells, recording using a multielectrode array on human cardiac cells differentiated from pluripotent stem cells and/or on an HL-1 cardiac cell line) and using in silico modeling on rat and human cardiac cell models. This will be followed by an in vivo analysis of the effect of the investigational compounds on the electrocardiogram of laboratory rats. Analysis of barium concentrations in blood and cardiac tissue samples from Czech patients will also be performed to provide a first insight in this field. The main aim of this project is to investigate the contribution of changes in Kir channel function to the arrhythmogenic mechanisms of the tested drugs and to identify likely risk factors predisposing patients to arrhythmias after sildenafil and aminophylline treatment.
104630;0826/2020;Predictive potential of dynamic changes in neutrophil and monocyte subpopulations in the development of SIRS and sepsis after surgery or trauma.;Vlková Marcela, Mgr. Ph.D.;67941;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Ústav klin. imunologie a alergolog.;Any trauma leads to activation of inflammation and to some extent leads to deregulation of immune system functions. A clear description of the events affecting the immune system as a result of trauma is still lacking, and the diagnosis of these first steps of immune activation may be crucial for the prediction and prevention of further complications during the patient's recovery. Trauma or surgery can induce a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which may further progress to a shock state accompanied by a multi-organ dysfunctional syndrome. On the other hand, trauma or surgery may be complicated by infection, which may progress to sepsis, which also has a systemic inflammatory response syndrome but is primarily caused by infection. Intensive efforts have been made to identify effective diagnostic and prognostic markers that could help in assessing the severity of the condition developed. However, there is still a lack of powerful and reliable tests for early prediction of the development of the aforementioned serious complications. New highly predictive and reliable markers would be very useful in situations where surgical patients develop SIRS or sepsis.
104610;0825/2020;The role of melatonin in the development of heart failure, a biomarker for patients with muscle dystrophy, and the effect of resynchronization on stem cell-differentiated cardiomyocytes;Rotrekl Vladimír, Mgr. Ph.D.;699;Partner;LF;Biologický ústav; The onset of SIRS-induced trauma affects the number and function of myeloid cells, making myeloid cells the first sensors of developing SIRS or sepsis. Changes in monocyte and neutrophil populations can be detected within the first few hours, and understanding these changes can have important implications for diagnostic inference and further prevention of the development of life-threatening conditions during sepsis. Neutrophils circulate in peripheral blood in large numbers and are ready for immediate activation upon encountering a pathogen. In addition, peripheral blood monocytes are a key subset of cells that drive the progression of sepsis. Our main objective is to investigate changes in neutrophil and monocyte subsets and their functionality associated with the progression of SIRS and sepsis in order to determine potential approaches for early diagnosis and to assess potential risk to the patient.

Ph.D.;699;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Biologický ústav;The role of endogenous melatonin in cardiac cells is unclear, but lowlevels of nocturnal melatonin in blood plasma and urine have been described in age-related cardiovascular disease such as ischemic heart disease and coronary syndrome. On the other hand, little is known about endogenous melatonin levels with respect to cardiac involvement in patients suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Endogenous melatonin is released even by cardiomyocytes in cell culture and thus may be monitored in wild type cell lines as well as patient specific (DMD) harbouring ones. Its supplementation impact on contraction mechanics have to be studied, as well as complex molecular biology methods.Results from melatonin measurements by novel Point of Care approach, will be correlated with cMRI long-term followup results and provide a new biomarker for early onset dilated cardiomyopathy, and alsopossible therapeutic target.
104570;0823/2020;Disruption of cerebral microcirculation and its relationship to markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in depressive disorder;Bartečků Elis, MUDr. Ph.D.;60219;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Psychiatrická klinika;"Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare condition caused by mutation in the NBN gene resulting in missing or abnormal nibrin molecule. Nibrin is a key member of MRX complex with significant effect on the DNA damage response (DDR). Its mutation yields in chromosomal instability frequently seen in patients' peripheral T-lymphocytes resulting in low CD45 immunocompromised phenotype. Patients further develop B/T-cell lymphomas with low success treatment rate using cytostatic treatment. Mean age of death in NBS children who developed tumor is 9.5 years. Currently there are no more treatment option for NBS except hematopoietic stem cell transplantation indicated in limited patient group. Conventional cytostatic drugs, however, induce toxicity often leading to septic shock or cardiotoxicity. Even higher mortality rate in the NBS patents is associated with secondary tumors which might be caused by chemotherapy induced selection of cancer stem cells. Thus, novel targeted therapies, possibly targeting cancer stem cell populations with less impact on cardiac muscle stemming from synthetic lethality in nibrin-defective cells and mechanisms to protect and strengthen lymphoid lineage differentiation in NBS patients are desired. We hypothesize, that nibrin mutation induced DNA abrasion leads to DNA damage mediated skewing in lymphoid/myeloid differentiation. This project focuses on pluripotent stem cell based model of NBS (NBS-hPSCs) patient on the dish, which will allow us i) to study DDR in stem cells with rationale to find novel ways of synthetic lethality to eradicate cancer stem cells; ii) determine the effect of nibrin mutation on lymphoid fate determination and its preservation and iii) establishing cardiac NBS model suitable for testing cardiac toxicity of novel treatment strategies for lymphomas in NBS patients."

MUDr. Ph.D.;141920;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Klinika dětské ORL;The inflammatory hypothesis is one of several theories about the neurobiology of depressive disorder (DP). It is based, among other things, on the observation that patients with DP exhibit elevated levels of several cytokines. It is likely that inflammation may affect the brain by its effect on the endothelium, which may lead to changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, neurovascular dysfunction, and these changes then further affect the cerebral microcirculation. The recently rediscovered method of intra-voxel incoherent motion imaging (IVIM) is able to obtain information not only about tissue structure as standard diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, but also about the microcirculation without the administration of contrast agents.

CSc.;104691;Příjemce;LF;Biologický ústav;Acute otitis media (OMA) is the most common inflammation in early childhood. It has been reported that nearly 2/3 of children experience acute otitis media by 2 years of age, in varying forms and severity, from inapparent forms to fulminant inflammation and marked symptomatology. The most common causes of OMA in children include Eustachian tube dysfunction and immature immune system. In the long term, using conventional culture techniques, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophillus influenzae and Moraxella catharhalis are considered the main bacterial causative agents of OMA. However, the knowledge of their interrelationships or the role of other species in the pathogenesis of OMA is still unclear. This project is aimed at identifying bacterial agents in samples of inflammatory fluid from the middle ear, nasopharyngeal swabs and from the external ear canal after myringotomy in children with acute otitis media. All samples will be subjected to 16S rRNA gene analysis and whole genome analysis including the identification of antibiotic resistance genes. Samples collected will also be examined by standard culture techniques as part of routine microbiological testing. The results will then be compared. Preventive measures (vaccination) and treatment (antibiotic therapy) will be determined based on the suspected causative agents of the inflammation. Our data may provide a completely new insight into the pathogenesis of OMA and may also significantly change preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

Ph.D.;106061;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Ústav histologie a embryologie;Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease in which menstrual tissue progressively grows outside the uterus, often causing severe pain and infertility in women. After retrograde menstruation, living endometrial tissue cells escape immune surveillance and apoptosis, leading to acute inflammation in the peritoneal microenvironment. It is imperative to better understand the origin of the pathophysiology of endometriosis, which affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age and increases the risk of ovarian cancer by 90% and breast cancer by 30%. Our previous results indicate the presence of immune cell populations including gamma-delta T cells, NK cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations in biopsies. Furthermore, we detected endometrial stromal cell populations that had mostly fibroblast morphology at P3 and resembled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in phenotype. Our aim is to analyze immune dysfunction of resident and recruited cells in patients with endometriosis, and to perform detailed analyses of gamma-delta T cell interactions in endometrial tissue, including secreted cytokines promoting severe chronic inflammation. Functional analyses of MSC cells with their significant regenerative potential will help to understand the molecular mechanisms and hormonal dysfunction underlying pathological changes in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle. Thus, we will be able to identify key genes as biomarkers that may be part of future immunotherapy for endometriosis.
104451;0808/2020;Identification of biomarkers for risk estimation and individualization of treatment in paediatric patients with juvenile and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis by analysis of temporal changes in biochemical and molecular markers;Repko Martin, prof. MUDr. Ph.D.;56089;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Ortopedická klinika;The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in the initiation, progression, metastasis and therapeutic response of breast cancer. The most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which promote tumor growth and invasion into the surrounding environment and modulate tumor response to treatment. Therefore, CAFs are attractive targets for the development of new therapies. However, CAFs are characterized by considerable heterogeneity in phenotypes and functions performed, which additionally vary according to tumor type. Thus, further research is needed to define reliable biomarkers predicting CAFs function in the tumor microenvironment, to develop effective therapies targeting CAFs with minimal side effects, and to tailor effective therapies targeting CAFs to patient needs (personalized therapy). In this project, we will develop advanced, pathophysiologically relevant ex vivo 3D culture models of tumor organoids and CAFs derived from patient tissues to aid research into the therapeutic and predictive potential of CAFs, and use this technology to develop a platform for personalized medicine. The results of this project will aid in the selection of reliable biomarkers of CAFs with prognostic/predictive value for given breast cancer types and the creation of a functional platform for testing therapeutic response in ex vivo patient tissue models, which will serve as a cornerstone of modern breast cancer diagnosis and patient-tailored treatment.

MUDr. Ph.D.;258796;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Anatomický ústav;Malignant melanoma and glioblastoma multiforme are aggressive tumours of neuroectodermal origin with limited treatment options, which also share a high frequency of deletions of the short arm of chromosome 9 at position 21.3 (9p21.3). The deletion leads to a loss of critical tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B, providing a selective growth advantage to cancer cells, but other nearby genes are often co-deleted. Among them, the MTAP gene encodes an enzyme of the methionine salvage pathway, which plays a vital role in polyamine and purine metabolism. In the proposed project, we will analyze the therapeutic potential of targeting the MTAP co-deletion as a cancer-specific metabolic liability. Other co-deletions with potential implications for cancer cell metabolism and growth will also be studied as potential vulnerabilities.

Ph.D.;123980;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Ústav histologie a embryologie;In melanoma, the most common genetic changes are BRAF and NRAS mutations. They cause over-activation of the ERK MAPK signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell survival and proliferation. BRAF inhibitors can lead to therapeutic response in melanoma patients, but resistance commonly emerges. Therefore, there is a need for additional treatment options. New research suggests that the oncogenic mutations cause strong cancer cell dependence on negative feedback regulation in the ERK pathway and can impact on cell metabolism and responses to stress. We plan to determine the therapeutic potential of targeting several potential vulnerabilities directly connected with the mutations of the BRAF and NRAS genes in melanoma in the proposed project.

MUDr. CSc.;122;Partner;LF;Ústav patologické fyziologie; Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been shown in recent years to be valuable and promising biomarkers in a wide range of human diseases. Short non-coding sncRNAs are by far one of the most studied molecules, particularly a specific subset of RNA transcripts consisting of 18-25 nucleotides called microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs have also been shown to be an important factor in relation to bone morphogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. This has made them interesting biomolecules to observe and study the molecular causes of idiopathic scoliosis. The present project focuses on the global profiling of miRNAs circulating in serum and on the determination of biochemical markers that are currently used to monitor bone metabolism in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. The aim is not only to compare with the profile of healthy individuals without degenerative changes in the spine, but also to monitor the dynamics of the levels of candidate molecules and correlate them with the clinical course of the disease to identify biomarkers that can be used to determine the risk of disease progression early and to adequately adjust the therapeutic approach.

Prostate cancer screening with MRI with a shortened protocol;Májek Ondřej, RNDr. Ph.D.;150629;Partner;LF;Inst.biostatistiky a analýz;Congenital developmental defects of the orofacial region are the most common congenital defects in children, occurring in the Czech Republic with an incidence of 1.8 children with clefts per 1000 healthy births. Care for children with cleft facial defects is multidisciplinary, centralized and takes place from birth to adulthood. At the University Hospital Brno, the Centre for the Treatment of Facial Clefts (CLRO) provides treatment for patients with orofacial clefts. The main specialties that form the basis of CLRO include plastic surgery, paediatric anaesthesiology and neonatology.  Patients with facial cleft defects are divided into 2 main groups according to the embryological causes of the cleft: 1/ patients with cleft lip, cleft jaw, without or with cleft palate (called total cleft) and 2/ patients with isolated cleft soft and hard palate. Anesthesia in children with orofacial cleft is specific not only to the age of the patients, but mainly to the cleft defect itself. Anesthetic management, and especially intubation of these patients, are often difficult due to the nature of the defect with frequent complications such as difficult intubation, desaturation, laryngospasm or bradycardia. In addition, approximately 90% of patients also experience soft tissue injury to the lip, alveolus, palate, nasal septum, as well as bony structures of the premaxilla and nasal septum during intubation. To facilitate intubation, improve anaesthetic management and increase the safety of anaesthesia in children with facial cleft defects, we have developed a customised protective 3D silicone obturator to be used during intubation to cover the alveolar arch and palatal defect. Based on the 3D scan, a mold will be printed on a 3D printer to cast the protective 3D obturator. The use of a protective 3D obturator can facilitate intubation of patients with facial cleft defects, reduce the incidence of anesthetic complications, and protect the soft and hard tissues of the palate and maxilla during intubation.

Despite a properly performed surgical technique, a significant proportion of patients experience sexual, urological and anal dysfunctions due to damage to the vegetative plexuses in the pelvis. From a clinical and anatomical point of view, the position of the plexuses and their transition to the rectum is unclear. From a functional point of view, the involvement of parasympathetic nerve fibres at the level of the 2nd-4th sacral vertebrae is particularly problematic. The main aim of the proposed project is to improve the quality of life of patients after TME on the basis of intraoperative neuromonitoring of pelvic plexuses, immunohistochemical detection of nerve fibers in the resection, supplemented by an anatomical study of the position of autonomic plexuses on cadaveric material. Patients' quality of life after the procedure will be verified by a clinical sexologist and urologist in addition to a questionnaire survey. Based on the results, a clinical protocol will be developed that can be used to predict the occurrence of sexual, urological and anal dysfunctions in the individual patient.

MUDr. Ph.D.;56089;Partner;LF;Ortopedická klinika;The overall goal of this project is to identify clinically relevant biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease based on the study of molecular mechanisms leading to the Alzheimer's disease phenotype. We hypothesize that infection of the brain by pathogens is one of the initial triggering factors leading to the accumulation of Aβ oligomers. This Aβ deposition is followed by the induction of cellular senescence in neurons and/or glia, which subsequently leads to inflammation, neuronal loss and dementia via SASP production. By combining samples from clinically well-defined patients, a unique stem cell-based model of brain organoids, and strong expertise in neurodifferentiation, aging, and SASP, we will be able to identify novel factors that specifically contribute to the initiation of AD. Importantly, based on data from in vitro analyses, we will focus on identifying relevant biomarkers that could be used to identify AD initiation from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Because AD likely begins decades before the actual onset of the disease, we believe that studying these two processes will contribute to knowledge with potential relevance to patient treatment.

MUDr. Ph.D.;24036;Příjemce;LF;Ústav klin. imunologie a alergolog.;"The aim of the project is to propose and evaluate the clinical relevance of hair cortisol analysis in personalized treatment of specific chronic disorders in the hypothalamohypophysial system. Cortisol levels are often associated with chronic stress and likely play an important role in several psychiatric disorders, including depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder. It may also serve as an effective tool in dose setting, dose adjustment, and monitoring the progression of diseases/disorders related to cortisol production, e.g., Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome, and/or other specific cases of hypo-/hypercortisolism. Determination of hair cortisol levels, which are longitudinal in nature, may contribute significantly to better outcomes in glucocorticoid replacement therapy or to the correct and early diagnosis of ectopic ACTH secretion in selected tumors. Long-term monitoring of cortisolism by determination of hair cortisol levels is of utmost importance for people with chronic, rare or equivocal diseases/disorders that cannot be easily diagnosed or their course monitored by conventional plasma or urinary cortisol determination. Segmentation of collected hair samples allows retrospective visualization of cortisol levels; therefore, it is an ideal candidate for long-term and objective testing in future diagnosis and monitoring of patients across multiple cohorts."

At least 200 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with olanzapine will be enrolled. The internationally recognised PANSS, CGI and UKU scales will be used as indicators of treatment efficacy and safety. These results will be statistically evaluated in a multivariate model taking into account the above genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. The results obtained will be used in personalizing pharmacotherapy and early identification of nonresponders to olanzapine treatment.

The key treatment strategy for PDAC is based on surgical resection and systemic chemotherapy. Survival time is significantly reduced by late detection of the disease, high metastatic potential of tumor cells and their resistance to cytostatic therapy. The global goal of this project is to identify predictors of disease progression and in particular chemoresistance in patients with indicated resection, using advanced biostatistical methods and artificial intelligence approaches. The prediction algorithm will be based on the analysis of unique primary PDAC cell lines and three-dimensional organoids derived from resected tumors. Input variables for prediction will include the energy metabolism status of tumor cells, expression of molecular regulators of tumor cell response to mitochondrial stress and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, spectral profiles obtained by mass spectrometry of intact cells, and correlation with clinical and histopathological data. Thus, the outcome of the project is the prediction of pancreatic cancer development and response to treatment based on unique highly complex biological input data. The project will also contribute to the possible identification of novel candidate molecules associated with the response to cellular stress and involved in the aetiopathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.

It is aimed at the development and implementation of a new diagnostic and separation system for the analysis of human sperm based on the state of their acrosome. The system uses antibodies against the CD46 protein, which is only detectable if the outer acrosomal membrane protecting the sperm acrosome is removed. The outer membrane of the acrosome is a very sensitive parameter of sperm condition. If CD46 proteins can be detected on the surface of the sperm, it is very likely that damage to the sperm head has occurred.  The

Ph.D.;106056;Příjemce;LF;Výzkumná skupina Pavla Krejčího;The frequent use of antibiotics results in bacterial strains that accumulate genes for antibiotic resistance. These strains are gradually replacing the original susceptible populations, especially in hospital settings. Therefore, there is an increasing demand from pharmaceutical companies and doctors for new and effective drugs. A conservative approach requires continuous development of new antibiotics, which is very costly and time-consuming. An alternative is the use of so-called phage therapy, i.e. preparations containing lytic bacteriophages, which are much less time and costly to develop and prepare. However, phage therapy still remains an experimental treatment due to the lack of regulatory rules for its registration. In addition to the use of phages alone or antibiotics, there is also the possibility of combining them to eradicate bacterial infections more effectively and to target previously resistant strains through synergistic effects. In addition, co-administration of phages and antibiotics increases patient safety in clinical trials by minimising the risk of developing a secondary infection from an overgrowth of a resistant strain, which could be fatal to the patient. The project will identify antibiotics with a positive impact on the growth characteristics of therapeutic staphylococcal phages 812 from the family Myoviridae and P68 from the family Podoviridae. The concentrations of the antimicrobials and bacteriophages will be optimised and tested in vitro and in vivo to evaluate their efficacy against resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus as well as their safety. The effect of combination therapy on the production of staphylococcal exotoxins compared to standard therapy will also be assessed. Based on the identified synergy and with regard to safety, a product combining phages and antibiotics with an enhanced effect on staphylococcal local infections, including chronic infections and biofilm, will be defined.

Recently, VS has been identified as a distinct neurological syndrome. However, the severity and symptomatology of this disorder are poorly described and its neural basis remains largely unknown. As a result, effective treatment of VS is lacking. In this project, we address gaps in the understanding of the symptomatology and neural underpinnings of VS. To this end, we will use approaches that have previously led to diagnostic and treatment advances in disorders comorbid with VS, such as tinnitus. First, we will develop VS-targeted questionnaires that will be used to map the prevalence, severity and comorbidities of VS in the Czech population. Second, we will conduct psychophysical laboratory experiments to quantify perceptual disturbances experienced by patients with VS and thus provide objective markers for diagnosis and therapy. Third, we will conduct a multimodal neuroimaging study to test new hypotheses about the neural correlates of VS. In contrast to previous studies, we consider VS in the context of brain networks responsible for perceptual processing, rather than narrowly focusing on visual hyperexcitability as the sole explanatory variable. We hypothesize that VS shares a common mechanism - dysfunction in a salient brain network - with comorbidities such as tinnitus. In experiments testing this hypothesis, we will use state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques to compare the brains of VS patients and healthy controls. We will examine brain structure (via diffusion tensor imaging, DTI), metabolism (via magnetic resonance spectroscopy, MRS), and functional connectivity between selected brain regions of VS patients and healthy controls (via ""stepwise"" connectivity analysis). Ultimately, this project will provide a detailed, mechanistic description of VS and inform the development of treatments for this still largely unexplored neurological disorder."

The biogenesis of a majority of the transmembrane and secreted signaling molecules depends on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi system. Within the ER, a number of proteins assist folding, post-translational modification, maturation, and transport to the cell membrane. Deregulation of these processes by inherited mutation, oncogenic transformation, or disrupted homeostasis of the organism can lead to improper folding of the proteins, their misplaced accumulation, and induction of ER stress. ER stress has been well studied in numerous pathologic processes that include neurodegeneration, metabolic diseases, inflammation or cancer, leading to identification of the key intracellular mediators of this process. How ER stress affects the cell communication systems based on membrane receptors, in turn contributing to cancer development, is however unclear, and it is a subject of the proposed research. The results of the project will introduce a novel paradigm into the cell biology, and will have implications for further studies on pathological signaling in chronic disease and cancer.

The pathogenesis of both groups of diseases is multifactorial, but the gut microbiota undoubtedly play a major role in the development and progression of both groups of diseases. According to the current evidence, it can be assumed that the mucosal microbiota contribute to the development of disease at a much higher rate than the luminal microbiota. Gram-negative gut bacteria, abundant in the adult colon, produce bacteriocins, which have been shown to have antibacterial, but also proapoptotic, probiotic and, in in-vitro studies, antineoplastic effects. In addition to bacteriocin production, intestinal bacteria are characterized by various virulence factors. Escherichia coli, as the main representative of the Enterobacteriaceae, can occur in the gut in four different genotypes. In addition to the basic genotypes, a number of potential, genetically encoded, virulence factors of the gut microbiome have been identified.

Instead of decline, the number of syphilis cases is increasing in many countries including China, US, and states in South America. In in the last decade in the Czech Republic, the total number of registered syphilis cases has varied from 696 to 1022 per year. The diagnosis of syphilis is, in most cases, based on clinical observations, anamnestic data and results of serology. Although serological tests are, in general, highly specific and sensitive, the major limitations of serological tests are lower sensitivity in early and late syphilis, the risk of false positive reaction caused by another acute or chronic infection or false negative results due to prozone effect in non-treponemal tests. During previous studies analysing effect of direct detection of TPA in clinical samples, the PCR positivity in swab samples reached 76.4%, which indicates a considerable detection rate that is comparable to serology. Moreover, this finding suggests that the direct detection of cellular TPA components is a plausible approach to improve diagnostics of syphilis. Therefore, the main aim of this grant proposal is a development of a new direct detection of the syphilis spirochete in the human clinical material and especially in the whole blood samples that are collected as a part of the standard current diagnostic procedure based on serological tests. The main specific aims of this project include i) development of direct method of TPA detection based on amplification of the chromosomal DNA, ii) detection of bacterial rRNA molecules, iii) development of sensitive methods for direct detection of antigen components of TPA and iv) MLST typing of TPA clinical isolates taken from patients in the Czech Republic.

Despite this, the application of targeted drugs in clinical practice is still burdened by shortcomings, such as poor pharmacokinetics of drugs and their adverse effects. These limitations can be overcome by increasing the selectivity and effectiveness of therapeutic modalities. Therefore, in the present project we plan to build on the concept of bioorthogonal chemistry to design and test novel hybrid ferritin-based biocompatible nanocatalysts for in situ cytotoxicity activation of non-toxic prodrugs. To achieve this goal, we have planned five major work packages: i) design and production of recombinant ferritins for catalyst encapsulation, ii) synthesis of catalysts for BOOM and IEDDA reactions and their encapsulation in ferritin, iii) synthesis of prodrugs, iv) study of the reactivity of hybrid nanocatalysts under cell-free conditions and tissue culture, and v) study of the antitumor efficacy of bioorthogonal pairs in a mouse model. The present project aims to open new avenues for the use of hybrid nanocatalysts in precision anticancer therapy.

A detailed understanding of the mechanism of splicing is key to their successful treatment. During splicing, introns are removed from the RNA and exons are spliced together to form mature mRNA. The most important sequences that are recognized during splicing are the donor (5'ss) and acceptor (3'ss) splice sites. The 5´ss consists of three exon and six intron nucleotides, and very different sequences can be used as functional 5´ss. In most cases, 5´ss recognition is dependent on U1 snRNP binding at or near the splice site, with the contribution of many other factors that stabilize this binding. The splicing itself proceeds in several steps, and disruption of any one of these steps can contribute to a failed splice. In this project, we will focus on the recognition of the 5´ss and the influence of factors that promote successful splicing at each stage of the process. The project will examine splicing in arteficial minigenes in relation to the presence of specific 5´ss and the wider genetic context.

Currently, the most effective procedure for identifying the EZ is the invasive EEG examination (IEEG). In the IEEG, we evaluate a wide range of EEG frequencies, including high-frequency oscillations (HFO; 80-500 Hz). Recently, our research group has shown that very high-frequency oscillations (VHFO,500 Hz-2 kHz) exist in the interictal period in patients with epilepsy. VHFOs seem to correlate better with the EZ range than traditional epigraphic or HFOs. The use of both standard macroelectrodes and innovative microelectrodes will allow us to study in detail the characteristics of VHFOs, specifically their frequency, relationship to pathology, surgical outcomes, 3 D distribution within the EZ, and propagation patterns. In the next step, we plan to develop an automated VHFO detector."

The role of apical initiation caspases (-8, -9) in bone development is less well understood. Research is complicated by the embryonic lethality of knock-out models, which also underscores the importance of these enzymes. The proposed project focuses on apical caspases-8 and -9 in the context of their role during chondroblast and osteoblast differentiation as cells that form cartilage and bone during development.

The length of the fertile period and the onset of menopause are associated with the depletion of the ovarian follicle supply and the onset of endocrine, metabolic and functional changes. The premature onset of menopause, ovarian failure or, in general, loss of the integrity of ovarian homeostasis are then significant risk factors for a number of pathologies, including cancer. In this project, we will study factors linking cellular and metabolic stress and changes accompanying ovarian aging, including genes responsible for regulating cellular responses. In particular, we will focus on the study of 1) the metabolism and cellular ultrastructure of the ovarian surface epithelium and the link to the induction of senescence, 2) the characterization of mitochondrial metabolism and the biochemical stress factors that influence it during ovarian cortical senescence, and 3) the description of the role of candidate genes involved in the stress response, regulation of senescence and metabolism, and increasing the risk of a tumorigenic phenotype.

Although enormous attention is focused on the study of application approaches in vitro, the real nature of these cells in the living organism remains highly elusive. In this proposal we will take advantage of the continuously growing teeth as an excellent model to study the biology standing behind the dynamics of mesenchymal stem cell niches and connect this knowledge with human dental regenerative biology. We have designed a complex experimental layout combining several state-of-the-art methods including lineage tracing and in-depth spatial single-cell transcriptomics. Our new concept can fundamentally change the current understanding of the role of dental mesenchymal stem cells in vivo into a complex of spatiotemporally separated stem cell niches each responsible for a specific role. These findings could have a direct impact on regenerative medicine in a general context and ultimately lead to biologically-based tooth engineering approaches.

Deep-learning approaches currently reign supreme in various image processing methods, including cell segmentation and classification. Large datasets are required to train these methods.

Most patients with HNSCC have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and unfortunately, no significant improvement has been achieved in HNSCC management to these days. The unpredictable therapy response and therapy resistance of HNSCC may be significantly supported by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs can promote HNSCC by secreting oncogenic factors. Many of these factors are contained in exosomes. The presence of many types of RNA within exosomes has been proven. We want to investigate the RNA cargo within CAFs-derived exosomes by using Next-Gen Sequencing and test these RNAs as biomarkers for clinically relevant characteristics of HNSCC patients indicated for curative surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. We will also try to find exosomal RNAs detectable in the venous blood of HNSCC patients which reflect the presence of a malignant tumor and treatment-resistant phenotype.

Chronic heart disease is accompanied by a reduction in TATS. However, a detailed mathematical analysis of the role of reduced TATS function in the development of heart failure is still lacking. We have therefore proposed a new reversible method that allows repeated measurements of TATS properties (fractional area and fraction of ion transporters in TATS). The method is based on the analysis of the electrical properties of TATS after exposure of the cell to an isotonic solution with low electrical conductivity (to increase the electrical resistance of the tubules). Data obtained from cells isolated from diseased and healthy human hearts will be complemented by optical measurements of TATS parameters using membrane protein labeling and by measuring transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and cell contraction. These data will be further used in a comprehensive mathematical model integrating cardiac cell, left ventricular and vascular function to simulate and quantitatively assess the effect of TATS reduction on cellular electromechanical activity and cardiac mechanics.

The prognosis of HNSCC is based on the TNM staging system, which ultimately results in the same treatment for different HNSCC tumors. This heterogeneity may lie in distinct metabolic profiles of individual HNSCC tumors. Many types of cancer exhibit metabolic symbiosis between tumor cells and cells of the surrounding stroma, mainly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This process involves transport of catabolites from CAFs to adjacent cancer cells by various transporters, such as monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCTs), which allows cancer cells to produce ATP, stimulate proliferation and reduce apoptosis. In this project, we want to further study the metabolic symbiosis between the cancer cells and surrounding stromal CAFs. Furthermore, we would like to investigate the metabolic profiles of distinct compartments within the HNSCC stroma with an effort to find potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets of HNSCC.

In addition to exogenous factors, endogenous factors modulate CYP activity. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is one of the regulatory homeostatic mechanisms in health and disease and is involved in the hormonal and immune response of the body, and its pleiotropic effects have not been studied in detail. This project aims to investigate the role of the ECS in regulating the activity of hepatic CYP enzymes. Changes in CYP activity, mRNA and protein levels, and changes in hormone levels will be monitored in rats following treatment with cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists and antagonists. Subsequently, their effect on human CYP will be investigated in human liver microsomal fraction and in HepG2, HepaRG cell lines. The aim is also to determine the time dependence of the observed changes. The results may have translational medical relevance, as the ECS is a promising target for the action of many drugs in areas such as the treatment of pain, vomiting, spasticity, epilepsy or autoimmune diseases and thus CB receptor ligands may interfere with drugs metabolized by CYP.

Membrane receptors rely on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi system for maturation, modification and transport to the cell surface. Because the cell communications are often mediated by small amount of receptors, their signaling may be affected by the general ER state. How the ER conditions affect membrane receptors is not known. Our data demonstrate that experimentally induced ER stress downregulated receptor synthesis, triggered degradation, or caused intracellular receptor accumulation. These changes lead to loss of receptors normally present at the cell surface and impaired signaling. The proposed research will examine the effect of ER stress triggered by senescence, cancer, hypoxia, caloric restriction and developmental defects, on signaling of 27 major receptor systems in organism, including growth factor, morphogene and cytokine receptors. The project will describe basic parameters of ER effect on cell ability to communicate via membrane receptors.

Not surprisingly, those processes are pharmacologically targeted in anticancer therapy, despite the fact that only little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. It becomes apparent that maintenance of processive DNA replication requires sophisticated protein networks beyond the core replisome. Whether there is a direct crosstalk between G4 and R-loops, what proteins are involved in their homeostasis and what are the factors diversifying between their beneficial and pathological roles, is not well understood. The goals of our research are to identify proteins associated with G4 and R-loop structures and understand their roles in G4/R-loop formation and resolution as well as relationship to replication fork progression and associated repair.

However, in vitro generated retinal cells are often poorly differentiated with impaired functionality demonstrated by not fully developed photoreceptor outer segments and less synaptic connectivity, which can be contributed to the lack of natural instructive signals that is normally available in vivo. In this project we aim to address these limitations by introducing instructive signals using photo-stimulation of human retinal cells. We have developed a unique optical device for high-throughput multi-wavelength light illumination of retinal organoids. Our preliminary results clearly indicate that photo-stimulation of differentiating retinal cells leads to enhanced differentiation. The proposed strategy combines the innovative photo-stimulation approach with stem cell biology research, allowing to study photo-induced effects on retinal development from a uniquely different perspective.

The chromosome of strain isolated by Nichols in 1912 was sequenced in 1998 and promoted further research leading to many studies on genome scale or on discrete genes/proteins. The proposed study will target the regions of the genome which are not covered by multi-clinical sample sequencing studies performed in last few years. These regions contain genes showing sequence diversity, paralogous genes and repetitive regions. The pipeline producing PCR products and sequencing them in parallel using Minion will be produced. The acquired results will be the basis for selection of target genes suitable for functional testing after heterologous expression in E. coli and B. burgdorferi.
122029;1191/2021;Analysis of neurodegenerative markers in Epilepsy;Sonawane Shivani Kishor;492336;Příjemce;LF;I. neurologická klinika;Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) interact with four types of cell surface receptors (FGFRs) to deliver signals critical for development and functioning of mammalian organs. FGFs trigger proliferative, migratory, anti-apoptotic and metabolic signaling, representing an attractive therapeutic option for tissue regeneration, metabolic syndromes and aging. Such use is however complicated by our poor knowledge of the molecular basis of FGF signaling. How a particular FGF regulates diverse cell responses is not known, and is the subject of the proposal. We will study the structure-function relationship of FGFs by engineering four members of FGF family, FGF8, FGF9, FGF10 and FGF18. We will obtain mutants with increased thermal stability and modified ability to interact with FGFRs and heparan sulphate. These FGF variants will be tested in cells for their ability to activate different types of signaling. The proposed research will unravel structural and biophysical properties of FGFs, which drive the specific cell response.
121972;1183/2021;The role of microbial community and interactions among bacterial species in cystic fibrosis patients;Snopková Kateřina, RNDr.;222811;Příjemce;LF;Mikrobiologický ústav;Dual effects on cardiac inward rectifier potassium (Kir) currents including IK1 have been demonstrated for various substances including the addictive substance ethanol (our published data) and the drug aminophylline (our preliminary data). Adverse proarrhythmic effects (especially fibrillation) were observed with both of these substances, which could be related to changes in IK1. The observed dual effect may cause unnatural arrhythmogenic heterogeneity of action voltages in cardiac tissue. The mechanism of the dual influence of ethanol and aminophylline is unknown. It may result either from a differential influence on the individual subunits forming these channels or from a combined direct and indirect influence (via second messenger systems). Detailed analysis of the interaction of ethanol and aminophylline with IK1 channels in isolated rat and human cardiac cells will be accompanied by measurements on expressed human Kir subunits and in silico modelling. A unique new population model of IK1 channels will be developed and inserted into our rat and human cardiac cell models to elucidate the mechanism of the dual effects of these compounds on IK1 and associated arrhythmogenesis.

Ciliogenesis associated kinase 1 (CILK1) is a sensitive regulator of cilia formation and architecture, conserved in its function through evolution. CILK1 mutations have been linked to lethal human developmental pathologies, and evidence of CILK1´s role in tissue homeostasis is also emerging. The molecular by which CILK1 regulates cilia is however not known, and is objective of this proposal. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that CILK1 regulates cilia by phosphorylation of proteins involved in assembly of protein complexes that are crucial for ciliogenesis and regulation of the intraflagellar transport. Using biochemical approaches and in cell experiments, we will identify the motifs among our candidate proteins that are phosphorylated by CILK1 in cells, and determine functional consequences of this phosphorylation in regulation of cilia. This will expand our understanding of basic ciliary processes, and potentially contribute to management of yet untreatable CILK1-mediated disorders.

Besides the secretion of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the epithelial cells of CP form the blood-CSF (B-CSF) barrier, an interface between the circulating blood and CSF.  Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence implying the involvement of the CP and B-CSF barrier in different neurological disorders such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), nerve injury, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the B-CSF barrier is among the least studied structures of the central nervous system (CNS) despite its clinical importance.

Ph.D.;324271;Příjemce;LF;Ústav histologie a embryologie;Peripheral neuropathic pain (NPB) accompanied by mechanical hyperalgesia is often due to traumatic nerve injury. Activation of delta-opioid receptors (DOR) on peripheral nociceptors produces analgesia with limited side effects. Experimentally, the functional competence of DOR is stimulated by inflammation and its mediators. In a model of NPB based on sciatic nerve injury (SNI), the bodies of injured and uninjured neurons are co-located in the corresponding spinal ganglia (SG). Based on our previous results and a pilot study, we hypothesize that functional competence of DOR by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines may take place at the level of nociceptive neurons in the SG. To test this hypothesis, we will use the SNI model and electrophysiological measurements of ex vivo skin-nerve preparations in combination with cellular detection of selected cytokines, chemokines and their receptors in nociceptive neurons of the SG. The role of cytokines and chemokine receptors in the functional competence of peripheral DOR will be verified in genetically modified mice.

MUDr. CSc.;1308;Příjemce;LF;Neurologická klinika;Previous studies of Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum (TPA), the causative agent of syphilis, have shown that laboratory strains and clinical isolates can be classified into two genetically distinct groups, the Nichols-like strains of TPA (Nichols-like strains) and the SS14-like strains of TPA (SS14-like strains). Because genetic transitions between the two groups of strains have not yet been found, and because SS14-like strains are preferentially found among clinical isolates, whereas Nichols-like strains are found among laboratory strains resulting from inoculation of human clinical isolates into experimental animals, we hypothesize that there are differences in the pathogenesis of the two groups of strains causing syphilis.  Thus, we plan to more precisely characterize the genetic diversity within and between Nichols-like and SS14-like strains or isolates, and to test for differences in the pathogenesis of disease caused by strains from the two TPA groups.  In vitro experiments consisting of cultivation of strains on tissue cultures of eukaryotic cells and in vivo experiments on groups of experimental animals (rabbits) will be performed, allowing to detect differences in growth characteristics and pathogenesis of TPA strains of both groups.

The advantage of these discharges is the high power density in the plasma enabling plasma activation of large volumes of working media, e.g. air with high water vapour content, but also pure water vapour. The active particles present in plasma-activated water vapour or aerosol have not yet been identified. The 2 types of surface discharges and the active particles generated by them with decontamination effect (radicals and reactive oxygen particles) will be studied in air and in oxygen with high water vapour content and in pure water vapour. Detection of the active particles will be carried out by physical and chemical methods, OES and LIF spectroscopy. The effect of the active particles on micro-organisms will be tested by culture, fluorescence and genetic methods and the decontamination effect of plasma activated media will be tested. The identification of the active particles but also the analysis of the UV and electrical properties of the discharges will allow their further optimization to improve their decontamination potential.

However, despite tremendous effort, the initial trigger of AD initiation that likely happens decades before the AD diagnosis is still unknown. And while the current body of research supports the concept that protein aggregation initiates the onset of AD, failure of over 413 clinical trials performed thus far that aimed to treat AD highlights the importance of introducing novel analytical strategies and methods to explore this disease from a new unbiased perspective. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to determine which molecules, molecular pathways, and cell types are altered during the initial phase of AD development and use this knowledge to validate markers (and possibly ""druggable targets"") of early disease onset. Specifically, we aim to 1) perform single-cell sequencing of our established functional AD-iPSCs-based model of brain organoids in the timeline experiments; 2) use unbiased data analysis to reveal molecules, molecular pathways, and cell types that are altered during the initiation of AD pathogenesis and pinpoint the relevant AD-driver change(s); and 3) evaluate if any of these novel findings could be used as early disease onset marker or possibly as AD drug-targets and perform functional studies of selected molecules. To this date, such single-cell seq analysis of AD-brain organoids has not been performed, nor has any of the available single-cell seq research from post-mortem AD-brains addressed the initial steps leading to the manifestation of AD pathology. Thus we believe that this project could significantly contribute to solving the initial trigger that stands behind the early steps of AD pathogenesis."

Using data from the Brno Growth Study (BGS), which monitored its participants from prenatal stages of development till adulthood and regularly collected many anthropometric, behavioural as well as biospecimen data, including hair samples and a follow-up on that study, we will focus on the three following objectives. First, we aim to assess stress-related alterations of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis function in early life by the analysis of cortisol from hair samples collected at birth and another three time points during the first year of life.  Second, we aim to assess the relationships between alterations of HPA axis function in early life and health, growth, and cognition during childhood and adolescence. Finally, we aim to conduct a neuroimaging, behavioral and developmental follow-up of a subset of the BGS participants in their early 60s to assess the relationships between alternations in HPA axis function during early life and brain and behavior in older adulthood. This interdisciplinary research capitalizing on a unique longitudinal cohort study bridges the fields of anthropology, medicine, and neuroscience and offers unprecedented breakthrough into the long-term health consequences of exposure to early life stress.

MUDr. Ph.D.;1100;Příjemce-koordinátor;LF;Mikrobiologický ústav; Kidney transplantation represents the gold standard for patients with ESRD. After transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs are crucial to reducing the risk for organ rejection. Apart from this desired effect, the compromised immunocompetence of the recipient leads to an increased risk for infectious disease. Moreover current immunosuppression regimens are unable to sufficiently control allorecognition of the graft, which leads to chronic rejection. Thus optimal management of immunosuppressive drug dosing requires a delicate balance between inadequate and excessive immunosuppression. At present, there is no diagnostic test or algorithm for optimal guidance of immunosuppressive drugs. Monitoring relies on the quantification of calcineurin inhibitor, mostly tacrolimus, through levels in the peripheral blood, which correlate more closely with the risk of drug-related toxicity than the immunosuppressive efficacy. There is an urgent need for tools to personalise immunosuppression thereby reducing the risk of infectious disease and, at the same time, graft rejection.
118523;0773/2021;Development and clinical use of a new method for identification of patients at risk of recurrent colorectal lesions and personalization of their dispensary care by determining mutational load and clinicopathological phenotype;Ngo Ondřej, Mgr.;356747;Partner;LF;Inst.biostatistiky a analýz;The positive effects of probiotics on host health have been described in many scientific studies on digestive tract diseases (e.g. acute and nosocomial diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, C. difficile, irritable bowel syndromes). In addition, probiotics may be of interest as adjuvants in the treatment of metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of action of probiotics, which are often a unique combination of multiple functions, has prevented a significant expansion of their application. The most widely used probiotics are lactic acid bacteria, followed by yeasts and non-pathogenic E. coli. This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of different E. coli genomes to identify genetic determinants specific to non-pathogenic and probiotic strains. Based on the identification and characterization of these probiotic markers, several candidate E. coli isolates will be selected and their probiotic potential will be tested experimentally. The project will result in the identification of factors that are typical and necessary for probiotic E. coli strains, which will allow easier characterization of probiotic E. coli and their application in medicine.

To study these phenomena, we propose to develop novel reporters that allow accurate quantification of senescence activation in human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). An iPSC-based model of neurodifferentiation will allow us to address the role of senescence in the development and aging of healthy human neurons, as well as to track this cellular response in the pathobiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). We believe that this study will not only introduce innovative approaches for AD/PD research, but will also help to unravel the role of senescence in the biology of healthy nervous systems and during neurodegeneration.

Pharmaceutical companies use them to identify compounds with desired biological activity that could lead to new therapies. We will develop and test a new rapid screening system for the high-throughput identification and characterization of small-molecule inhibitors of the translation initiation complex eIF4F, identified as a potential therapeutic target in many human cancers, including drug-resistant malignant melanoma. The current portfolio of eIF4F inhibitors is limited, and none of the compounds has entered the clinical evaluation phase. It is caused, at least in part, by the fact that the state-of-the-art approaches for eIF4F inhibitor identification and characterization are based on techniques that are costly, time-consuming, or rely on expensive equipment for automated image analysis. In contrast, our novel approach, based on a recent identification by our group of previously unknown eIF4F targets, will overcome most limitations of the currently used techniques. Our unique know-how will allow us to develop a new cell-based system better suited for the high-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical libraries for compounds targeting eIF4F than the currently available screening systems.

The CRISPR/Cas9 transfection of normal male skin fibroblast cell line with the novel ABCD1 variant detected in the patient suspected of X-ALD can be an effective approach to fulfil this goal. Peroxisomal oxidation will be measured in CRISPR/Cas9 prepared ABCD1 variant ""knock-in"" and results will be compared with ABCD1 wt and pathogenic variant. Germline pathogenic ABCD1 variant means a 50% risk for the carrier that every offspring will carry the same variant. Preimplantation techniques followed by in vitro fertilisation are recommended for the ABCD1 mutation carriers.  If the VUS shows up to be a benign variant or polymorphism, only population risk of de novo X-ALD exists. So the functional analysis can help the ABCD1 VUS carriers to decide whether the preimplantation technique is suitable for them or not necessary."

In orthopaedic implants, there is the added issue of tissue cells competing with bacteria for the opportunity to adhere to the surface of the material and thus achieve proper osseointegration. These complications can lead to the need for implant replacement. The proposed project aims to study the effect of the parameters of nanotubes prepared by anodic oxidation on the surface of titanium material on the adhesion, viability and biofilm formation ability of bacterial strains that predominantly populate orthopaedic implants in clinical practice.

The choroid plexus forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, crucial for brain homeostasis, plays a significant role in the clearance of amyloid-β. During Alzheimer's disease, insufficient clearance of amyloid-β and enhanced inflammatory changes in the choroid plexus and cerebrospinal fluid, are observed. Despite its clinical importance, our knowledge of the role of the choroid plexus in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease remains rather limited. We intend to carry out an integrative approach-based study to better understand the underlying mechanisms by which choroid plexus responds to the amyloid-β toxicity.

Recently, a novel role of Cav-1 in the regulation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) formation was uncovered. Nevertheless, the exact effect of Cav-1 on EVs release, cargo sorting and protein composition of EVs is not known. Many studies suggest that aggressive cancer cells release higher amounts of EVs compared to non-malignant cells, which makes the effect of Cav-1 on EVs secretion highly important and attractive for anticancer therapy. The project aims to evaluate the role of Cav-1 in cargo sorting into EVs and the resulting protein composition of EVs produced by prostate cancer cells and the effect of prostasomes on process of malignant transformation.

Yet, HNSCC cancer cells have a specific sensitivity to some types of cell death which can synergize with cisPt treatment. Ferroptosis is a regulated cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation after ROS accumulation. Targeting it can be a new approach for advanced HNSCC treatment since related genes are significantly enriched in HNSCC. The enhancement of some chemotherapy drugs effects in combination with ferroptosis inducers was already described. Focusing on synergistic effects of cisplatin-induced oxidation stress and reducing antioxidant capacity during ferroptosis can increase the effectivity and even reverse the conventional treatment resistance.

MUDr. Ph.D.;2042;Příjemce-koordinátor;CEITEC;VS Milana Brázdila;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a heterogeneous group of membrane-bounded vesicles released by all cells. Since EVs contain thousands of different cellular proteins and a large number of nucleic acids, which together represent a kind of imprint of the parent cell, a wide range of potential applications is offered. Also, cells undergoing the process of cell death release EVs into their surroundings, which not only affect surrounding and relatively distant cells with different effects, but also carry specific information about the type of cell death that is taking place in the dying cells. Given the difficulty of specifically and sensitively detecting different types of cell death in vivo, EVs thus offer a valuable tool to monitor the response of a cell population to therapy using specific molecules.
